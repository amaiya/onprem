Even with today’s seemingly fast pace of AI breakthroughs, the development of long-promised technologies such as self-driving cars, housekeeping robots, and conversational companions has turned out to be much harder than many people expected.  One reason for these repeating cycles is our limited understanding of the nature and complexity of intelligence itself.  In this paper I describe four fallacies in common assumptions made by AI researchers, which can lead to overconﬁdent predictions about the ﬁeld.  I conclude by discussing the open questions spurred by these fallacies, including the age-old challenge of imbuing machines with humanlike common sense.  Introduction The year 2020 was supposed to herald the arrival of self-driving cars.  Five years earlier, a headline in The Guardian predicted that “From 2020 you will become a permanent backseat driver” [1].  In 2016 Business Insider assured us that “10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020” [2].  Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk promised in 2019 that “A year from now, we’ll have over a million cars with full self-driving, software...everything” [3].  And 2020 was the target announced by several automobile companies to bring self-driving cars to market [4, 5, 6].  Despite attempts to redeﬁne “full self-driving” into existence [7], none of these predictions has come true.  It’s worth quoting AI expert Drew McDermott on what can happen when over-optimism about AI systems—in particular, self-driving cars—turns out to be wrong: Perhaps expectations are too high, and... this will eventually result in disaster.
