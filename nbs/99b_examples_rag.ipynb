    "In this notebook, we will use a model called **[Zephyr-7B-beta](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GGUF)**, which [performs well on RAG tasks](https://www.rungalileo.io/hallucinationindex).  When selecting a model, it is important to inspect the model's home page and identify the correct prompt format.  The prompt format for this model is [located here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GGUF#prompt-template-zephyr), and we will supply it directly to the `LLM` constructor along with the URL to the specific model file we want (i.e., *zephyr-7b-beta.Q4_K_M.gguf*).  We will offload layers to our GPU(s) to speed up inference using the `n_gpu_layers` parameter. (For more information on GPU acceleration, see [here](https://amaiya.github.io/onprem/#speeding-up-inference-using-a-gpu).) For the purposes of this notebook, we also supply `temperature=0` so that there is no variability in outputs.  You can increase this value for more creativity in the outputs. Finally, we will choose a non-default location for our vector database."

Ktrain allows users to make choices that best fit their unique application requirements while also automating certain tasks algorithmically or through setting well-performing defaults. Its goal is to augment and complement human engineers rather than attempting to entirely replace them, thereby better exploiting the strengths of both humans and machines."
