The prompt format for this model is [located here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GGUF#prompt-template-zephyr), and we will supply it directly to the `LLM` constructor along with the URL to the specific model file we want (i.e., *zephyr-7b-beta.Q4_K_M.gguf*).  We will offload layers to our GPU(s) to speed up inference using the `n_gpu_layers` parameter. (For more information on GPU acceleration, see [here](https://amaiya.github.io/onprem/#speeding-up-inference-using-a-gpu).) For the purposes of this notebook, we also supply `temperature=0` so that there is no variability in outputs.  You can increase this value for more creativity in the outputs. Finally, we will choose a non-default location for our vector database."

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are utilized in various research projects described in the provided context in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data-Driven Approaches**: Many projects leverage AI techniques to analyze complex datasets and identify patterns that are not easily discernible through traditional methods. For example, in the project on engineered photonic materials, AI is used to develop new materials with tailored properties by consolidating information on material compositions and geometries.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Model Development and Prediction**: AI and ML are employed to create predictive models that can simulate the behavior of materials under different conditions. The project on recycled polymers utilizes AI to predict deformation and failure mechanisms in recyclates, enhancing their mechanical performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Optimization**: Machine learning algorithms are used for optimizing the design and synthesis processes of materials. In the project focused on luminescent biomaterials, iterative Bayesian optimization is applied to screen proteins for desired luminescent properties, facilitating the discovery of new materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enhanced Characterization**: In the study of nanofibers, machine learning aids in understanding and mitigating defects that compromise strength by predicting stress fields around nanovoids and assessing the impact of atomic crosslinks on material properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Multiscale Simulations**: AI enhances multiscale modeling approaches, where simulations at different scales (from atomic to macro) are integrated to provide insights into material performance. For instance, the project on 3D printed polymer composites combines computational modeling with experimental data to understand fracture mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Education and Workforce Development**: Several projects include educational components that involve teaching AI and ML techniques to students from diverse backgrounds, thereby preparing the next generation of engineers and scientists with skills relevant to emerging technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, AI and ML are essential tools in these projects, facilitating advancements in material science, improving predictive capabilities, and enhancing the understanding of complex physical phenomena."
