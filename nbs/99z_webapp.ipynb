    "- If you're finding answers get cut off, edit the configuration to set `max_tokens` to higher value than the default 512. (Not necessary when using Ollama, which uses a larger value by default.)\n",
    "- You can change the store type in the config to `store_type=\"sparse\"`, which stores documents in a traditional search engine index, instead of a vector database.  The advantage is that ingestion is a lot faster.  The drawback is that sparse vectorstores assume passages with answers will include at least one word in common with the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- For reasons that are unclear, parallelized ingestion in the Web interface when running on Windows 11 tends to pause for a long while before starting.  For these reasons, parallelization is disabled for the Web interface when running it on Windows 11.  When running on Windows systems, we recommend ingesting documents through the Python interface."
