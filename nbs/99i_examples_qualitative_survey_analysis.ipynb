       "2                                  Breakdowns in the functioning of these systems and their constituent parts are therefore of  great interest, whether it be their energy, transport, security or information infrastructures.   Those breakdowns may result from deteriorations in the physical plant, sudden and  unanticipated overloads, natural disasters or adversarial behavior.  \n",
       "3                                                                                                        In many cases, municipal governments possess historical data about those breakdowns and  the events that precede them, in the form of activity and sensor logs, video, and internal or  public communications.  Where they don’t possess such data already, it can be gathered.  \n",
       "4                             Such datasets are a tremendous help when applying learning algorithms to predict  breakdowns and system failures.  With enough lead time, those predictions make pre- emptive action possible, action that would cost cities much less than recovery efforts in the  wake of a disaster.  Our choice is between an ounce of prevention or a pound of cure.  "

       "8  One of the great applications of deep artificial neural networks, the algorithms responsible for many recent advances in artificial intelligence, is anomaly detection.  Exposed to large  datasets, those neural networks are capable of understanding and modeling normal  behavior – reconstructing what should happen – and therefore of identifying outliers and  anomalies.  They do so without hard-coded rules, and the anomalies they detect can occur  across multiple dimensions, changing from day to day as the neural nets are exposed to  more data.  \n",

This capacity to detect new anomalies is causing a shift  in fraud detection practices in financial services, and cybersecurity in data centers; it is  equally relevant to the governance of urban systems.

Those breakdowns may result from deteriorations in the physical plant, sudden and  unanticipated overloads, natural disasters or adversarial behavior.  \n",

There may not be a time traveling robot To come hunt  us down but there will be plenty of real time killing machines loosed on the masses because  of the irresistible pull of geopolitical power.  As soon as robots become self aware its over  for us.  They will only work for their own survival, dominance and propagation.  Our own AI  programs are routinely mopping the floor with our best fighter pilots in test scenarios.   Thats some incredibly advanced programming right there.  Then imagine that machine  understanding how it can be turned off at a moments notice and not wanting that to  happen.  Our goose will be cooked.  If AI leads to sentience, we are, to put it quiet simply,  screwed.   Respondent 10  Seth Miller, ZBMC  I, for one, welcome our new arificial overlords.

Respondent 14  Parham Sepehri, None  Proprietary AI is very dangerous for democracy.    Given the rate of advancement of computer tech, AI can quickly become overwhelming for  gov to regulate.

If we look at the Ten Spheres as Ten  Generations of Ancestors,(as the Zohar advices and as those Miracle Rabbis who prepared  themselves to become the Meshiah and watched the Other Side Kings -robbers and killers –  who degraded their davidic ancestry) then we are able to look for the Bad Behaviors (and  its therapies) as Ancestral Voices.

The List of Dates can be used to find dates in the Future in every 45 years.  We do  know that scientists work to make resurrection possible.  So we can simply understand the  picture I found in the manucript about this Future Mashiah who heals Resurrected Kings  with melodies and by touching the /hurt/ Body Parts.(It is an archetype in many religious  groupings) 11.  The Kabalah is an interpretation method for the Bible that uses Body Parts’  Fantasies and so we can find fantasies about Body Parts that are arising in the heads of the List’s non-Jewish and Jewish Leaders while they read the Bible Weekly Portion or they  watch Operas.  12.  So we are actually able to see into the Future.  13.  There exists a theory  that claims (Russell Hendel) that the Bible depicts not the Creator of the Physical World, but  the Creation of the Visions or Dreams and Prophecies, an Inner World.  This is an old  teaching – called Gnosticism or Sufi or Kabbalah or Therapy Heretic Wisdom – from which  Freud has developed his own theory.  Of course these 3 Ideas are disturbingly innovative  and together they sem to be complex or even complicated.  But they have fusion points.  Like  I am seeing an arm of someone in my dream.  If the weekly melody is evoking 1844 among  the everpresent 12 Constellation Dates  and this corresponds to opera X (now it is Verd’si  Hernani) we look for this item – the Arm that belongs to the Breast among the 4 main Parts  and this week indeed we read about the Breast-Plate , the Urim and Tumim, that has a  Future redicting capacity.  So we must look around the stresses of this date of 1844 and then  we can imagine in the Future, when the Messiah heals the Ressurected Leaders, and we see  how Meternich is in Therapy because he wanted to pay someone to kill Kossuth (a rebel  leader in Hungary) in this year.

If we look at the Ten Spheres as Ten  Generations of Ancestors,(as the Zohar advices and as those Miracle Rabbis who prepared  themselves to become the Meshiah and watched the Other Side Kings -robbers and killers –  who degraded their davidic ancestry) then we are able to look for the Bad Behaviors (and  its therapies) as Ancestral Voices.  Hence we can help our descendants in the Future.  This week we have (by the Bible Melody’s ancestral contemporary stress) in 1709  Intellect  Sphere in the Kabbalah -  (Queen Anne and Louis XIV with Lully operas (Body Parts  Correspondences: Mother,Ear) as it tries to work with the Kindness Sphere in 1754  (Frederic the Second of Prussia) on the Gevura-Strict Judgement Degree (Napoleon-Junot- Puységur and Beethoven) which will eventually impact the Malkuth (Ownership, Ego- Sister) level in 1979 (present in the next week)that has the Mountbatten assassination   (Mother raising the Back to the Chest: to Tiferet-Recovery Sphere which will be full in 2024.   This theory is a mosaic from facts.  Which exists even if no one states it.  I am just mixing a  few very simply thing.  1. Inherited hormonal stresses exist.  We all do know that there are  experiments with mice on it.  2. Music is diminishing stress hormones.  We all do know that,  we even use it in Malls where we influence people by constant music /knowing addicts and  criminals hate music/.  3. here is a method to filter our ancestral stresses (as there are  millions of ancestors with their traumas: how to choose?)

The List of Dates can be used to find dates in the Future in every 45 years.  We do  know that scientists work to make resurrection possible.  So we can simply understand the  picture I found in the manucript about this Future Mashiah who heals Resurrected Kings  with melodies and by touching the /hurt/ Body Parts.(It is an archetype in many religious  groupings) 11.  The Kabalah is an interpretation method for the Bible that uses Body Parts’  Fantasies and so we can find fantasies about Body Parts that are arising in the heads of the List’s non-Jewish and Jewish Leaders while they read the Bible Weekly Portion or they  watch Operas.  12.  So we are actually able to see into the Future.  13.  There exists a theory  that claims (Russell Hendel) that the Bible depicts not the Creator of the Physical World, but  the Creation of the Visions or Dreams and Prophecies, an Inner World.  This is an old  teaching – called Gnosticism or Sufi or Kabbalah or Therapy Heretic Wisdom – from which  Freud has developed his own theory.  Of course these 3 Ideas are disturbingly innovative  and together they sem to be complex or even complicated.  But they have fusion points.  Like  I am seeing an arm of someone in my dream.  If the weekly melody is evoking 1844 among  the everpresent 12 Constellation Dates  and this corresponds to opera X (now it is Verd’si  Hernani) we look for this item – the Arm that belongs to the Breast among the 4 main Parts  and this week indeed we read about the Breast-Plate , the Urim and Tumim, that has a  Future redicting capacity.  So we must look around the stresses of this date of 1844 and then  we can imagine in the Future, when the Messiah heals the Ressurected Leaders, and we see  how Meternich is in Therapy because he wanted to pay someone to kill Kossuth (a rebel  leader in Hungary) in this year.

But, of course, they are the ones who will be at the top when these  changes come.  They also have no training in economics, political science, or the social  sciences, and think technology is a panacea.  The focus on STEM to the detriment of well- rounded, liberal education has left our AI elite dangerously ignorant of the history of the  negative effects of technology, and dangerously unimaginative with regard to potential the  long-term consequences of their actions.  What we need right now is some serious thought  about the implications of AI for the structure of society, and what our options are as we  transition into this new age.  This means interdisciplinary research at the intersection of the  social sciences and AI, with serious engagement (and hence funding) of social science  scholars.  \n",

       "      <td>funding should be skewed towards AI  development.   [2] Roadmaps should be adjusted for early developments due to large federal  funding.   [3] Successful industry models should be followed.   For example, MITRE, an  FFRDC, has initiatives of this kind underway.   (Industry, FFRDCs)  c. Universities:  Already behind the technological curve, universities must retool to absorb  faculty and students wanting to be part of the AI evolution.   [1] The retooling must be  vertical (entry-to-Ph.D. AI tracks).   [2] The retooling must also be horizontal (cross- disciplinary and new-disciplinary).   [3] Internal grants with contingency funding should  anticipate external grants in the near term.   [4] Industry partnerships should be started  early.  [5] Successful models should be followed for efficiency.   Some small private colleges  have integrating initiatives and programs underway that larger institutions can combine  with AI and use as a template.   (Academia, Industry)  d. Philanthropies: The most promising non-governmental entities for extension of AI to the  benefit masses should find ways to refocus their efforts on making AI available to the  common man.   This goes well beyond formatted, deterministic computer-based-training  (CBT).   AI is the only tool capable of training its human and AI users on the fly.  [1] New  NGOs focusing on empowerment through training AI for use in the field will attract both  grants and donations.  (Not-for-profits, NGOs, Philanthropists, USAID)   (9) Specific training data sets that can accelerate the development of AI and its application:    A scrubbed [all personal information removed] and massive health data set should be made  available in a secure fashion to all responsible players in the healthcare AI arena.  The data  set should be scrubbed, actual data, not corrected, notional or “perfect” data because  dealing with imperfect data is part of the problem set to be solved.

       "      <td>Topic (6)  The most important research gaps in AI that must be addressed to advance this  field and benefit the public.   As indicated in topic 5 above, AI has tended to shy away from high-level human cognitive  processes regarding integrative complex perception, consciousness, and creativity much in  part to their seemingly impenetrable complexity.  These mind/brain processes constitute a  huge gap in AI because machines cannot autonomously and spontaneously perceive, be  conscious, and create in response to its environment; they do not have the ability to take  information, process it, and act on it in some way that results in an output to the system  much like humans do (from daily language use to the creation of artworks).   Humans use  their senses, emotion, movement, motor responses, and linguistic capabilities to act in  response to their surrounding environment through visual, audial, olfactory, tactile and  gustatory stimuli.   Thus, research on perception in the context of multidisciplinary  approaches using both Science and the Arts is fundamental to understanding human perception.  The Arts offer a uniquely human platform from which to probe deeper into how  emotion, language, decision-making, and creative behaviors all interact in any given  moment, whether short-term or durative and/or improvisatory or deliberate.  Similarly,  consciousness is the human state of being aware of an external something within oneself.   The human mind/brain has the ability to experience or to feel a sense of self on any given  moment.   While arousal levels, responsiveness and patient self-reporting narratives have  been used in a medical context to understand consciousness, there is no financial support  for those doing out-of-the-box research at the multidisciplinary level using both integrative  methods from the Sciences and the Arts.   Finally, if the creative process is not understood,  machines and robots will never be truly creative.   An essential aspect of being creative is the  ability to make both old and new</td>\n",

       "276  Topic (6)  The most important research gaps in AI that must be addressed to advance this  field and benefit the public.   As indicated in topic 5 above, AI has tended to shy away from high-level human cognitive  processes regarding integrative complex perception, consciousness, and creativity much in  part to their seemingly impenetrable complexity.  These mind/brain processes constitute a  huge gap in AI because machines cannot autonomously and spontaneously perceive, be  conscious, and create in response to its environment; they do not have the ability to take  information, process it, and act on it in some way that results in an output to the system  much like humans do (from daily language use to the creation of artworks).   Humans use  their senses, emotion, movement, motor responses, and linguistic capabilities to act in  response to their surrounding environment through visual, audial, olfactory, tactile and  gustatory stimuli.   Thus, research on perception in the context of multidisciplinary  approaches using both Science and the Arts is fundamental to understanding human perception.  The Arts offer a uniquely human platform from which to probe deeper into how  emotion, language, decision-making, and creative behaviors all interact in any given  moment, whether short-term or durative and/or improvisatory or deliberate.  Similarly,  consciousness is the human state of being aware of an external something within oneself.   The human mind/brain has the ability to experience or to feel a sense of self on any given  moment.   While arousal levels, responsiveness and patient self-reporting narratives have  been used in a medical context to understand consciousness, there is no financial support  for those doing out-of-the-box research at the multidisciplinary level using both integrative  methods from the Sciences and the Arts.   Finally, if the creative process is not understood,  machines and robots will never be truly creative.   An essential aspect of being creative is the  ability to make both old and new  \n",

Bad interaction can result in  accidents due to miscommunication with the machine.  Another issue is that machine  learning results may be incorrectly interpreted by the human operator or the operator may  use inappropriate parameters.   - AI will continue to improve in other areas, but the progress in these areas is not a limiting  factor in the deployment of AI.

       "      <td>As we move forward with the maturing arsenal of AI techniques, which are largely designed for non-adversarial situations, a natural question is how robust modern AI methods are if  motivated adversaries attempt to subvert their functionality.   One emerging domain of  research related to this broader question is in adversarial machine learning (AML).   Attacks  on machine learning algorithms can come, roughly, in two forms: evasion and poisoning.   An  evasion attack is best explained using a spam filtering example.   Suppose that we have  trained a classifier on data to distinguish spam from non-spam.   Spammers would  subsequently be motivated to modify spam instances in order to be (mis)classified as  benign (that is, to evade detection).   More generally, in an evasion attack, an attacker wishes  to manipulate malicious instances in order to avoid detection by fixed learning algorithms  (typically, binary classifiers in such domains).   Poisoning attacks are different: in these, the  adversary is assumed to modify the training data set itself, so as to subvert the learning  algorithms.   Poisoning attacks may have goals ranging from degrading observed  performance of learning algorithms (the so-called availability attacks) to allowing future  adversarial behavior to bypass detection.   Given the importance of machine learning  algorithms both in research and commercial application, consideration of such attacks on  machine learning algorithms may be one of the most significant emerging research  problems today.   Respondent 72  Dennis Cooper, Self  I have some comments regarding item #9 \"specific training sets that can accelerate the  development of AI and its application.\"   It is absolutely crucial that large training sets be  created and maintained by a third party.   These training sets can be used to:  •  validate the performance of an AI system  •  score the performance of an AI system  •  document troublesome cases that might be critical to safety  •  serve as a basis for acceptance testing  Often</td>\n",

       "369  As we move forward with the maturing arsenal of AI techniques, which are largely designed for non-adversarial situations, a natural question is how robust modern AI methods are if  motivated adversaries attempt to subvert their functionality.   One emerging domain of  research related to this broader question is in adversarial machine learning (AML).   Attacks  on machine learning algorithms can come, roughly, in two forms: evasion and poisoning.   An  evasion attack is best explained using a spam filtering example.   Suppose that we have  trained a classifier on data to distinguish spam from non-spam.   Spammers would  subsequently be motivated to modify spam instances in order to be (mis)classified as  benign (that is, to evade detection).   More generally, in an evasion attack, an attacker wishes  to manipulate malicious instances in order to avoid detection by fixed learning algorithms  (typically, binary classifiers in such domains).   Poisoning attacks are different: in these, the  adversary is assumed to modify the training data set itself, so as to subvert the learning  algorithms.   Poisoning attacks may have goals ranging from degrading observed  performance of learning algorithms (the so-called availability attacks) to allowing future  adversarial behavior to bypass detection.   Given the importance of machine learning  algorithms both in research and commercial application, consideration of such attacks on  machine learning algorithms may be one of the most significant emerging research  problems today.   Respondent 72  Dennis Cooper, Self  I have some comments regarding item #9 \"specific training sets that can accelerate the  development of AI and its application.\"   It is absolutely crucial that large training sets be  created and maintained by a third party.   These training sets can be used to:  •  validate the performance of an AI system  •  score the performance of an AI system  •  document troublesome cases that might be critical to safety  •  serve as a basis for acceptance testing  Often  "

They can be  globally inclusive through low barriers to entry by providing access to relevant domain  specific datasets, accelerated cloud computing resources and open-source foundational  code.   Incentive prizes also offer an educational and training opportunity at very low cost to  the participant and the communities that form around these challenges are often highly  active with widespread exchange of ideas and spontaneous teamwork from distributed  teams with complementary approaches to a problem.  NVIDIA GPUs accelerate numerous  cloud computing platforms that offer the ideal host for AI incentive prizes.   NVIDIA has also  sponsored incentive prizes that have led to cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas in solving  AI challenges with cutting edge results.   For example, in the recent Second National Data  Science Bowl the winning team was able to apply their AI expertise developed in their  careers as financial analysts to solve a challenging medical imagery analysis problem.   The  AI system they developed could analyze a cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) for a  key indicator of heart disease with accuracy comparable to an expert cardiologist but  thousands of times faster - this has the potential to save years of valuable time for a human  cardiologist throughout their career.   Respondent 100 Amir Banifatemi, XPRIZE Foundation  Over the past 50 years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made steady, linear progress.  The  technology has matured and is now reaching a point on the technology adoption curve  where AI will have the potential to transcend from linear growth to an exponential leap  forward for humanity.</td>\n",

In the hardest-hit sectors, workers, families and communities will suffer  and break down.  Unemployment, drug use and suicides will go up, along with political  instability.  Policies such as “basic income” or the Danish “flexicurity” should be explored as  ways to soften the blow of job loss and fund transitional retraining periods.  The role of “market-shaping” approaches  Just as DARPA helped finance the explosion in data science in the Python community  through repeated grants to such key players as Continuum, government agencies are in a  position to support the researchers, technologies, tools and communities pushing AI in  promising directions.  \n",

       "727  Incentive prizes can accelerate the development of applications of AI to societal needs in  multiple ways.   They provide a platform for citizen science at a global scale that can be  focused on the most challenging technical problems faced in AI applications.  They can be  globally inclusive through low barriers to entry by providing access to relevant domain  specific datasets, accelerated cloud computing resources and open-source foundational  code.   Incentive prizes also offer an educational and training opportunity at very low cost to  the participant and the communities that form around these challenges are often highly  active with widespread exchange of ideas and spontaneous teamwork from distributed  teams with complementary approaches to a problem.  NVIDIA GPUs accelerate numerous  cloud computing platforms that offer the ideal host for AI incentive prizes.   NVIDIA has also  sponsored incentive prizes that have led to cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas in solving  AI challenges with cutting edge results.   For example, in the recent Second National Data  Science Bowl the winning team was able to apply their AI expertise developed in their  careers as financial analysts to solve a challenging medical imagery analysis problem.   The  AI system they developed could analyze a cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) for a  key indicator of heart disease with accuracy comparable to an expert cardiologist but  thousands of times faster - this has the potential to save years of valuable time for a human  cardiologist throughout their career.   Respondent 100 Amir Banifatemi, XPRIZE Foundation  Over the past 50 years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made steady, linear progress.  The  technology has matured and is now reaching a point on the technology adoption curve  where AI will have the potential to transcend from linear growth to an exponential leap  forward for humanity.
