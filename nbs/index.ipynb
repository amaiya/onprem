Confidence scores are used to sort and prune candidate answers before returning results. The entire workflow can be implemented with only three lines of code using ktrain's SimpleQA module. This system allows for the submission of natural language questions and receives exact answers, as demonstrated in the provided example.

Set `n_gpu_layers=-1` to offload all layers to the GPU (this will offload all 33 layers to the default model). You can reduce the value if you get an error (e.g., `CUDA error: out-of-memory`).  For instance, using two old NVDIDIA TITAN V GPUs each with 12GB of VRAM, 59 out 83 layers in a [quantized Llama-2 70B model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-70b-chat.Q3_K_S.gguf) can be offloaded to the GPUs (i.e., 60 layers or more results in a \"CUDA out of memory\" error).\n",
