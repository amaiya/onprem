When selecting a model, it is important to inspect the model's home page and identify the correct prompt format.  The prompt format for this model is [located here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF#prompt-template-mistral), and we will supply it directly to the `LLM` constructor along with the URL to the specific model file we want (i.e., *mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf*).  We will offload layers to our GPU(s) to speed up inference using the `n_gpu_layers` parameter. (For more information on GPU acceleration, see [here](https://amaiya.github.io/onprem/#speeding-up-inference-using-a-gpu).) For the purposes of this notebook, we also supply `temperature=0` so that there is no variability in outputs.  You can increase this value for more creativity in the outputs."

      "Firstly, we are proud to announce that our Model Y SUV has officially gone into production at our new factory in Berlin, Germany. This marks an important milestone for Tesla as we continue to expand our vehicle lineup and global manufacturing footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the Model Y production ramp-up in Europe, we are also making significant progress on several other fronts. For instance, we recently unveiled the latest version of our Autopilot advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). This new iteration of Autopilot features significant improvements in object detection and classification, as well as enhanced lane centering capabilities. These advancements are designed to help make Autopilot even safer and more effective for our customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another exciting development at Tesla relates to our ongoing efforts to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. In this regard, we are pleased to announce that we have recently signed a major new agreement with the utility company NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra) to develop and construct up to 2 gigawatts (GW) of new solar projects in the United States. This represents one of the largest renewable energy partnerships in history, and it is an important step forward in our mission to help lead the world's transition to sustainable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, we are extremely proud of the progress that Tesla has made over the past year, and we are excited about the many new developments and innovations that are on the horizon for our company. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to all of our dedicated employees, customers, investors, and partners who have supported us along the way. Together, we are helping to shape a brighter and more sustainable future for ourselves, our planet, and generations to come.\n",
