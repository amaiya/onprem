    "text": "Create orchestrated document-processing pipelines using simple YAML configuration files. Instead of writing code, you design workflows by connecting and chaining together different types of nodes. Allows you to solve problems by assembling pre-designed building blocks.\n\n\n\nQuick Start - Three Core Examples\nCommand-Line Usage\nVisual Workflow Builder\nWorkflow Structure\nPort Types and Data Flow\nNode Types Reference\nConfiguration Options\nAdvanced Examples\nValidation and Error Handling\nBest Practices\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nThe workflow engine provides three essential patterns that cover the most common document processing scenarios:\n\n\nPurpose: Download and perform thematic analysis of the State of the Union address using chunking and aggregation.\n# Requires: set OPENAI_API_KEY  \npython -m onprem.workflow yaml_examples/1_direct_analysis.yaml\nWhat it does: - Downloads the State of the Union text automatically from GitHub - Chunks the speech into 1000-character segments with 100-character overlap - Extracts thematic keywords from each chunk (policy areas, topics) - Cleans and standardizes theme responses for consistency - Aggregates all themes into comprehensive political analysis - Exports both detailed themes (CSV) and summary analysis (JSON)\nRequirements: - Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, as example uses GPT-4o-mini. Local LLMs can be used as well. - Internet connection for document download\n\n\n\nPurpose: Load PDF files, chunk them, and store in a vector database for later retrieval.\n# Run from the workflows directory\npython -m onprem.workflow yaml_examples/2_ingest_pdfs.yaml\nWhat it does: - Loads PDF files from ../sample_data/ - Converts PDFs to markdown for better processing - Chunks documents into 800-character pieces with 80-character overlap - Stores in ChromaDB vector database at document_vectors/\nRequirements: PDF files in the sample_data directory\n\n\n\nPurpose: Query an existing vector database, apply AI analysis, and export results.\n# Requires: Run example 1 first + set OPENAI_API_KEY\npython -m onprem.workflow yaml_examples/3_analyze_from_vectorstore.yaml\nWhat it does: - Searches the vector database created in example 1 - Applies AI analysis to find documents about “artificial intelligence machine learning” - Uses GPT-3.5-turbo to analyze each document for topic, key points, and relevance - Exports results to document_analysis_results.xlsx\nRequirements: - Run example 2 first to create document_vectors/ - Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, as GPT-4o-mini is used. Local LLMs can be used as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npython -m onprem.workflow &lt;workflow.yaml&gt;\n\n\n\n\nThe OnPrem.LLM web UI includes a Visual Workflow Builder that can generate and execute YAML-based workflows through a point-and-click interface with no coding required.\n\nSee the web UI documentation for more information.\n\n\npython -m onprem.workflow &lt;workflow.yaml&gt;\n\n\n\n# Show help and examples\npython -m onprem.workflow --help\n\n# Validate workflow without running\npython -m onprem.workflow --validate workflow.yaml\n\n# List all available node types\npython -m onprem.workflow --list-nodes\n\n# Run quietly (suppress progress output)\npython -m onprem.workflow --quiet workflow.yaml\n\n# Show version\npython -m onprem.workflow --version\n\n\n\n# Run the PDF ingestion workflow\npython -m onprem.workflow yaml_examples/1_ingest_pdfs.yaml\n\n# Validate a workflow before running\npython -m onprem.workflow --validate yaml_examples/2_analyze_from_vectorstore.yaml\n\n# See all available node types\npython -m onprem.workflow --list-nodes\n\n\n\n\nThe three core examples demonstrate the main workflow patterns:\n\n\nDocuments → Chunking → Vector Store\nUse this pattern to build searchable databases from your document collections.\n\n\n\nVector Store → Query → AI Analysis → Export\nUse this pattern to analyze specific topics from large document collections using semantic search.\n\n\n\nDocuments → Full Processing → AI Analysis → Cleanup → Export\nUse this pattern for comprehensive analysis of entire document collections without intermediate storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoadFromFolder - Load all documents from a directory\nLoadSingleDocument - Load a specific file\nLoadWebDocument - Download and load from URL\nLoadSpreadsheet - Load text from spreadsheet rows with metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nSplitByCharacterCount - Chunk by character count\nSplitByParagraph - Chunk by paragraphs (preserves structure)\nKeepFullDocument - Keep documents whole, optionally concatenate pages\n\n\n\n\n\nAddMetadata - Add custom metadata fields to documents\nContentPrefix - Prepend text to document content\nContentSuffix - Append text to document content\nDocumentFilter - Filter documents by metadata or content criteria\nPythonDocumentTransformer - Custom Python transformations\n\n\n\n\n\nChromaStore - Vector database for semantic search\nWhooshStore - Full-text search index\nElasticsearchStore - Hybrid search capabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nQueryDualStore - Search dual vector store (sparse, semantic, and hybrid search)\nQueryChromaStore - Search vector database\nQueryWhooshStore - Search text index\nQueryElasticsearchStore - Search Elasticsearch index\n\n\n\n\n\nPromptProcessor - Apply AI analysis using custom prompts (DocumentProcessor)\nResponseCleaner - Clean and format AI responses (ResultProcessor)\nSummaryProcessor - Generate document summaries (DocumentProcessor)\n\nPythonDocumentProcessor - Execute custom Python code on documents (DocumentProcessor)\nPythonResultProcessor - Execute custom Python code on processing results (ResultProcessor)\nDocumentToResults - Convert documents to export-ready results (bridges Query → Exporter)\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregatorNode - Aggregate multiple results into single result using LLM (AggregatorProcessor)\nPythonAggregatorNode - Aggregate multiple results using custom Python code (AggregatorProcessor)\n\n\n\n\n\nCSVExporter - Export to CSV format\nExcelExporter - Export to Excel format\n\nJSONExporter - Export to JSON format\nJSONResponseExporter - Extract and export JSON from LLM responses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a file called my_workflow.yaml:\nnodes:\n  document_loader:\n    type: LoadFromFolder\n    config:\n      source_directory: \"/path/to/your/documents\"\n      verbose: true\n  \n  text_chunker:\n    type: SplitByCharacterCount\n    config:\n      chunk_size: 500\n      chunk_overlap: 50\n  \n  search_index:\n    type: WhooshStore\n    config:\n      persist_location: \"my_search_index\"\n\nconnections:\n  - from: document_loader\n    from_port: documents\n    to: text_chunker\n    to_port: documents\n  \n  - from: text_chunker\n    from_port: documents\n    to: search_index\n    to_port: documents\n\n\n\nfrom onprem.workflow import execute_workflow\n\n# Execute the workflow\nresults = execute_workflow(\"my_workflow.yaml\", verbose=True)\nOr programmatically:\nfrom onprem.workflow import WorkflowEngine\n\nengine = WorkflowEngine()\nengine.load_workflow_from_yaml(\"my_workflow.yaml\")\nresults = engine.execute(verbose=True)\n\n\n\n\nA workflow YAML file has two main sections:\n\n\nDefines the processing nodes in your pipeline:\nnodes:\n  node_id:              # Unique identifier for this node\n    type: NodeTypeName  # Type of node (see Node Types Reference)\n    config:             # Configuration specific to this node type\n      parameter1: value1\n      parameter2: value2\n\n\n\nDefines how data flows between nodes:\nconnections:\n  - from: source_node_id    # Source node ID\n    from_port: output_port  # Output port name\n    to: target_node_id      # Target node ID  \n    to_port: input_port     # Input port name\n\n\n\n\nThe workflow system uses a strongly-typed port system to ensure data consistency and prevent invalid connections. Understanding port types is essential for building valid workflows.\n\n\nThere are three main port types in the workflow system:\n\n\nMost common type - Contains LangChain Document objects with content and metadata.\n# Document structure\nDocument(\n    page_content=\"The actual text content of the document...\",\n    metadata={\n        \"source\": \"/path/to/file.pdf\",\n        \"page\": 1,\n        \"author\": \"John Smith\",\n        \"extension\": \"pdf\"\n    }\n)\nUsed by: - All Loader → TextSplitter connections - All TextSplitter → Storage connections\n- All Query → Processor connections\n\n\n\nProcessing output - Contains structured analysis results, summaries, or prompt responses.\n# Results structure\n[\n    {\n        \"document_id\": 0,\n        \"source\": \"research.pdf\",\n        \"prompt\": \"Analyze this document and provide...\",\n        \"response\": \"TOPIC: AI Research | TECH: Neural networks | LEVEL: Advanced\",\n        \"original_length\": 1247,\n        \"metadata\": {\"page\": 1, \"author\": \"Smith\", \"year\": 2023}\n    }\n]\nUsed by: - All Processor → Exporter connections\n\n\n\nAggregated analysis - Contains a single dictionary with consolidated results from multiple inputs.\n# Aggregated result structure\n{\n    \"aggregated_response\": \"Top 3 topics: AI (80%), automation (65%), data science (45%)\",\n    \"source_count\": 12,\n    \"aggregation_method\": \"llm_prompt\",\n    \"topic_analysis\": {\n        \"top_topics\": [\"AI\", \"automation\", \"data science\"],\n        \"coverage_percentage\": 75.5\n    },\n    \"original_results\": [...]  # Reference to source data\n}\nUsed by: - AggregatorNode and PythonAggregatorNode outputs - Can be exported using Exporter nodes (converted to single-row format)\n\n\n\nCompletion status - Simple text messages indicating operation results.\n# Status examples\n\"Successfully stored 150 documents in WhooshStore\"\n\"Exported 25 results to analysis_report.xlsx\"\n\"No documents to store\"\nUsed by: - Storage node outputs (terminal) - Exporter node outputs (terminal)\n\n\n\n\nRaw Files → List[Document] → List[Document] → str\n   ↓            ↓               ↓             ↓\nLoader    TextSplitter      Storage      Status\n\nAlternative analysis path:\nIndex → List[Document] → List[Dict] → str  \n  ↓         ↓              ↓         ↓\nQuery   Processor      Exporter  Status\n\nNew direct export path:\nIndex → List[Document] → List[Dict] → str\n  ↓         ↓              ↓         ↓\nQuery  DocumentToResults Exporter Status\n\nNew aggregation path:\nIndex → List[Document] → List[Dict] → Dict → str\n  ↓         ↓              ↓         ↓      ↓\nQuery   Processor     Aggregator Export Status\n\n\n\nThe workflow engine validates that connected ports have matching types:\n✅ Valid Connections:\n# Document processing chain\n- from: loader\n  from_port: documents        # List[Document]\n  to: chunker\n  to_port: documents         # List[Document] ✓\n\n# Analysis chain  \n- from: query\n  from_port: documents        # List[Document]\n  to: processor\n  to_port: documents         # List[Document] ✓\n\n- from: processor\n  from_port: results          # List[Dict]\n  to: exporter\n  to_port: results           # List[Dict] ✓\n❌ Invalid Connections:\n# Type mismatch\n- from: loader\n  from_port: documents        # List[Document]\n  to: exporter\n  to_port: results           # List[Dict] ❌\n\n# Wrong direction\n- from: storage\n  from_port: status           # str (terminal node)\n  to: processor\n  to_port: documents         # List[Document] ❌\n\n\n\n\ndocuments - Always contains List[Document] objects\nresults - Always contains List[Dict] with analysis results\n\nresult - Always contains Dict with single aggregated result (AggregatorProcessor output)\nstatus - Always contains str with completion messages\n\n\n\n\nData flows preserve metadata throughout the pipeline:\n\nLoader → Document metadata (source, extension, dates, etc.)\nTextSplitter → Preserves original metadata in chunks\nQuery → Returns documents with original metadata\nProcessor → Includes metadata in results under metadata key\nExporter → Flattens metadata into columns (meta_source, meta_page, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nWhen port types don’t match, you’ll see validation errors like:\nWorkflowValidationError: Type mismatch: \nloader.documents (List[Document]) -&gt; exporter.results (List[Dict])\nWorkflowValidationError: Target node processor has no input port 'status'. \nAvailable: ['documents']\nUnderstanding these port types helps you: - Design valid workflows - Debug connection errors - Understand data transformations - Plan processing pipelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoader nodes read documents from various sources and output List[Document].\n\n\nLoads all documents from a directory using ingest.load_documents.\nnodes:\n  my_loader:\n    type: LoadFromFolder\n    config:\n      source_directory: \"/path/to/documents\"    # Required: Directory path\n      ignored_files: [\"temp.txt\", \"draft.doc\"] # Optional: Specific files to skip\n      include_patterns: [\"*.pdf\", \"*.docx\"]    # Optional: Only load files matching these patterns\n      exclude_patterns: [\"*draft*\", \"*temp*\"]  # Optional: Skip files matching these patterns\n      verbose: true                             # Optional: Show progress\n      pdf_markdown: false                       # Optional: Convert PDFs to markdown\n      pdf_unstructured: false                   # Optional: Use unstructured PDF parsing\n      n_proc: null                             # Optional: Number of CPU cores (null = all)\n      store_md5: false                         # Optional: Store MD5 hash in metadata\n      store_mimetype: false                    # Optional: Store MIME type in metadata\n      store_file_dates: false                  # Optional: Store file dates in metadata\n      infer_table_structure: false             # Optional: Extract tables from PDFs\n      caption_tables: false                    # Optional: Generate table captions (requires llm)\n      extract_document_titles: false           # Optional: Extract document titles (requires llm)\nFilename Pattern Filtering:\n\ninclude_patterns: Only process files matching these glob patterns (e.g., [\"*.pdf\", \"*.doc*\"])\nexclude_patterns: Skip files matching these glob patterns (e.g., [\"*draft*\", \"*backup*\"])\nIf both specified, file must match include pattern AND not match exclude pattern\nUses standard Unix glob patterns: * (any chars), ?

    "text": "The workflow system uses a strongly-typed port system to ensure data consistency and prevent invalid connections. Understanding port types is essential for building valid workflows.\n\n\nThere are three main port types in the workflow system:\n\n\nMost common type - Contains LangChain Document objects with content and metadata.\n# Document structure\nDocument(\n    page_content=\"The actual text content of the document...\",\n    metadata={\n        \"source\": \"/path/to/file.pdf\",\n        \"page\": 1,\n        \"author\": \"John Smith\",\n        \"extension\": \"pdf\"\n    }\n)\nUsed by: - All Loader → TextSplitter connections - All TextSplitter → Storage connections\n- All Query → Processor connections\n\n\n\nProcessing output - Contains structured analysis results, summaries, or prompt responses.\n# Results structure\n[\n    {\n        \"document_id\": 0,\n        \"source\": \"research.pdf\",\n        \"prompt\": \"Analyze this document and provide...\",\n        \"response\": \"TOPIC: AI Research | TECH: Neural networks | LEVEL: Advanced\",\n        \"original_length\": 1247,\n        \"metadata\": {\"page\": 1, \"author\": \"Smith\", \"year\": 2023}\n    }\n]\nUsed by: - All Processor → Exporter connections\n\n\n\nAggregated analysis - Contains a single dictionary with consolidated results from multiple inputs.\n# Aggregated result structure\n{\n    \"aggregated_response\": \"Top 3 topics: AI (80%), automation (65%), data science (45%)\",\n    \"source_count\": 12,\n    \"aggregation_method\": \"llm_prompt\",\n    \"topic_analysis\": {\n        \"top_topics\": [\"AI\", \"automation\", \"data science\"],\n        \"coverage_percentage\": 75.5\n    },\n    \"original_results\": [...]  # Reference to source data\n}\nUsed by: - AggregatorNode and PythonAggregatorNode outputs - Can be exported using Exporter nodes (converted to single-row format)\n\n\n\nCompletion status - Simple text messages indicating operation results.\n# Status examples\n\"Successfully stored 150 documents in WhooshStore\"\n\"Exported 25 results to analysis_report.xlsx\"\n\"No documents to store\"\nUsed by: - Storage node outputs (terminal) - Exporter node outputs (terminal)\n\n\n\n\nRaw Files → List[Document] → List[Document] → str\n   ↓            ↓               ↓             ↓\nLoader    TextSplitter      Storage      Status\n\nAlternative analysis path:\nIndex → List[Document] → List[Dict] → str  \n  ↓         ↓              ↓         ↓\nQuery   Processor      Exporter  Status\n\nNew direct export path:\nIndex → List[Document] → List[Dict] → str\n  ↓         ↓              ↓         ↓\nQuery  DocumentToResults Exporter Status\n\nNew aggregation path:\nIndex → List[Document] → List[Dict] → Dict → str\n  ↓         ↓              ↓         ↓      ↓\nQuery   Processor     Aggregator Export Status\n\n\n\nThe workflow engine validates that connected ports have matching types:\n✅ Valid Connections:\n# Document processing chain\n- from: loader\n  from_port: documents        # List[Document]\n  to: chunker\n  to_port: documents         # List[Document] ✓\n\n# Analysis chain  \n- from: query\n  from_port: documents        # List[Document]\n  to: processor\n  to_port: documents         # List[Document] ✓\n\n- from: processor\n  from_port: results          # List[Dict]\n  to: exporter\n  to_port: results           # List[Dict] ✓\n❌ Invalid Connections:\n# Type mismatch\n- from: loader\n  from_port: documents        # List[Document]\n  to: exporter\n  to_port: results           # List[Dict] ❌\n\n# Wrong direction\n- from: storage\n  from_port: status           # str (terminal node)\n  to: processor\n  to_port: documents         # List[Document] ❌\n\n\n\n\ndocuments - Always contains List[Document] objects\nresults - Always contains List[Dict] with analysis results\n\nresult - Always contains Dict with single aggregated result (AggregatorProcessor output)\nstatus - Always contains str with completion messages\n\n\n\n\nData flows preserve metadata throughout the pipeline:\n\nLoader → Document metadata (source, extension, dates, etc.)\nTextSplitter → Preserves original metadata in chunks\nQuery → Returns documents with original metadata\nProcessor → Includes metadata in results under metadata key\nExporter → Flattens metadata into columns (meta_source, meta_page, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nWhen port types don’t match, you’ll see validation errors like:\nWorkflowValidationError: Type mismatch: \nloader.documents (List[Document]) -&gt; exporter.results (List[Dict])\nWorkflowValidationError: Target node processor has no input port 'status'. \nAvailable: ['documents']\nUnderstanding these port types helps you: - Design valid workflows - Debug connection errors - Understand data transformations - Plan processing pipelines",

    "text": "Applying LLMs to Documents in Pre-Existing Search Engines\nMany applications have documents already stored in a conventional Elasticsearch index with no vector embeddings. Surprsingly, you can still apply RAG and semantic sesarch to such documents despite the fact that they have not been preprocessed for generative AI.\n\nRAG With an Existing Elasticsearch Index\nThe ElasticsearchSparseStore module in OnPrem.LLM allows you to point OnPrem.LLM to any Elasticsearch instance for RAG and semantic similarity applications.\nYou can do so by instantiating ElasticsearchSparseStore as follows:\nfrom onprem.ingest.stores import VectorStoreFactory\nstore = VectorStoreFactory.create(\n    kind='elasticsearch_sparse', \n    persist_location='https://localhost:9200',\n    index_name='NAME_OF_YOUR_INDEX',\n    # Map OnPrem.LLM field names to your existing field names\n    content_field='content',      # Your content field name\n    id_field='doc_id',            # Your ID field name\n    source_field='filepath',      # Your source field name (optional)\n    content_analyzer='english',   # Your analyzer (defaults to standard)\n    # Optional: Authentication if needed\n    basic_auth=('elastic', 'CHANGEME'),\n    verify_certs=False, # change to True if you provide path to ES certs as we did above\n    # Optional: Enable semantic search with dynamic chunking\n    chunk_for_semantic_search=True,\n    chunk_size=500,\n    chunk_overlap=50.\n    n_candidates=25,       # number of documents to inspect for answer (default: limit*10)\n)\n\n# traditional keyword search\nresults = store.search('\"machine learning\"', filters={'extension' : 'pdf') # assuming here you have an extension field in your index\n\n# semantic searches (no vectors need to be indexed in your Elasticsearch instance!)\nresults = store.semantic_search('\"machine learning\"', return_chunks=False) # set return_chunks=True for RAG applications\n# best matching chunk from document\nbest_chunk_id =  results[0].metadata['best_chunk_idx']\nprint(results[0].metadata['chunks'][best_chunk_id]\n\n# OUTPUT: 'of the machine learning (ML) workflow such as data-preprocessing and human-in-the-loop\n#          model tuning and inspection. Following inspiration from a blog post by Rachel Thomas of\n#          fast.ai (Howard and Gugger, 2020), we refer to this as Augmented Machine Learning.'\n\n# RAG\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm = LLM(n_gpu_layers=-1)\nllm.load_vectorstore(custom_vectorstore=elasticsearch_store)\nresult = llm.ask('What is machine learning?')\nThe interesting thing in this example above is that:\n\nEmbeddings do not have to be stored in the Elasticsearch index and are computed dynamically.\nDocuments do not even need to be pre-chunked in your index.\n\n\n\nRAG With SharePoint Documents\nYou can also point OnPrem.LLM to SharePoint documents.\n# connect to SharePoint\nfrom onprem.ingest import VectorStoreFactory\nconnection_params={'persist_location':\"https://sharepoint.YOUR_ORGANIZATION.org\", # URL of your SharePoint site\n                   'username':os.getenv('USERNAME'), # e.g., CORP\\username\n                   'password':os.getenv('PASSWORD'),\n                    'n_candidates':10}  # maximum number of Sharepoint documents to inspect for answer (default: limit*10)\nstore = VectorStoreFactory.create('sharepoint', **connection_params)\n\n# traditional keyword search (results are entire documents)\nresults = store.search('\"generative AI\" AND \"material science\"', where_document=\"NSF\", limit=10)\n\n# semantic search (results are text chunks from entire documents)\nresults = store.semantic_search('Can generative AI be applied to material science?', where_document='NSF AND \"material science\"', limit=4)\n\n# RAG\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm = LLM(n_gpu_layers=-1, verbose=0)\nllm.load_vectorstore(custom_vectorstore=store)\nresult = llm.ask('Can generative AI be applied to material science?', limit=4, where_document='NSF AND \"material science\"')\nFor RAG with SharePoint, we offer the following recommendations: 1. Many SharePoint sites are configured to not return the indexed text content as part of the query results. In these situations, OnPrem.LLM will attempt to download the documents from SharePoint and perform real-time text extraction and text chunking. For these reasons, a lower n_candidates value is recommended (see above). 2. SharePoint Search uses the Keyword Query Language (KQL) — a proprietary query language designed by Microsoft for SharePoint and other Microsoft search products (like Exchange and Microsoft Search). KQL is missing some features that are useful in yielding relevant results. For these reasons, we recommend you help the LLM target the right documents by provding a supplemental query to filter documents via the where_documents argument, as we did above.\n\n# Clean up temporary directories\nimport shutil\n\ntemp_dirs = [chroma_path, whoosh_path, documents_dir]\nfor temp_dir in temp_dirs:\n    try:\n        shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)\n    except:\n        pass\n        \nprint(\"🧹 Cleaned up temporary directories\")\n\n🧹 Cleaned up temporary directories",

It automates where possible but also allows users to make choices based on their unique requirements. Ktrain supports TensorFlow Keras models and includes out-of-the-box support for tasks like text classification, sequence tagging, image classification, node classification, and link prediction. It offers state-of-the-art models like BERT and fastText, learning rate finders, optimization techniques, explainable AI tools, and a simple prediction API for deployment. Ktrain is an open-source machine learning platform that automates various tasks beyond just model selection and architecture search in AutoML approaches. It provides text classification, regression, sequence tagging, topic modeling, document similarity, recommendation, summarization, and question answering for text data, as well as node classification and link prediction for graph data. Overall, ktrain aims to augment human engineers' strengths rather than replace them in the ML process.\n\n\nTips: For faster summarizations, we set max_chunks_to_use=5, so that only the first five chunks of 1000 characters are considered (where chunk_size=1000 is set as the default).

It also suggests establishing a pilot program at select institutions to expand graduate and pre-doctoral degree programs.\n2. **Funding for Advanced Hypersonics Facilities**: The committee recommends increasing funding for advanced hypersonics facilities for research and graduate-level education, allocating $543.9 million (an increase of $3.0 million) in PE 0601153N for hypersonic education efforts.\n3. **Hypersonics Prototyping**: The committee mentions two programs related to hypersonics prototyping: HYPERSONICS PROTOTYPING ($150,340) and HYPERSONICS PROTOTYPING—HYPERSONIC ATTACK CRUISE MISSILE (HACM) ($381,528).\n4. **Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonics Test Bed (MACH-TB)**: The committee encourages the Department of Defense to fully fund the MACH-TB program in future budget requests to achieve full-scale flight test objectives and expansion of critical test infrastructure.\n5. **Hypersonic Workforce Development**: The committee expresses concern about the Department's ability to sustain a highly skilled workforce for hypersonic technology development and recommends expanding and fully funding science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs, particularly in the field of hypersonics.\n\nOverall, the context emphasizes the importance of advancing hypersonic technology for national defense and highlights the need for education, workforce development, and research investments to support this effort.\n\n\n\n\nSummarize a blog post on LLMs with respect to prompting\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\")\ndocs = loader.load()\nwith open('/tmp/blog.txt', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(docs[0].page_content)\n\nsummary, sources = summarizer.summarize_by_concept('/tmp/blog.txt', concept_description=\"prompting\")\n\n\nprint(summary)\n\nThe context discusses \"prompting\" as a technique used to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) and influence their behavior, particularly in the context of autonomous agent systems.\n\nIn this context, prompting refers to providing specific instructions or questions to an LLM to elicit a particular response or action. The goal is to guide the model's thinking process and encourage it to generate more accurate, relevant, or useful outputs.\n\nThere are several types of prompts mentioned:\n\n1. **Simple prompting**: Providing basic instructions, such as \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\"\n2. **Task-specific instructions**: Providing domain-specific guidance, like \"Write a story outline\" for writing a novel.\n3. **Human inputs**: Incorporating human feedback or input into the prompting process.\n\nThe context also highlights various techniques that use prompting to enhance LLM performance on complex tasks, including:\n\n1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: A technique that instructs the model to \"think step by step\" and decompose hard tasks into smaller steps.\n2. **Tree of Thoughts**: An extension of CoT that explores multiple reasoning possibilities at each step.\n3. **LLM+P**: A method that relies on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning.\n\nOverall, the context emphasizes the importance of prompting in guiding LLMs and enabling them to perform more effectively in complex tasks.",

Extra parameters to LLM (e.g., ‘device=’cuda’) are forwarded diretly totransformers.pipeline. If supplying amodel_id` parameter, the default LLM backend is automatically changed to Hugging Face transformers.\n# LLama-3.1 model quantized using AWQ is downloaded and run with Hugging Face transformers (requires GPU)\nllm = LLM(default_model='llama', default_engine='transformers')\n\n# Using a custom model with Hugging Face Transformers\nllm = LLM(model_id='Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct', device_map='cpu')\nSee here for more information about using Hugging Face transformers as the LLM backend.\nYou can also connect to Ollama, local LLM APIs (e.g., vLLM), and cloud LLMs.\n# connecting to an LLM served by Ollama\nlm = LLM(model_url='ollama/llama3.2')\n\n# connecting to an LLM served through vLLM (set API key as needed)\nllm = LLM(model_url='http://localhost:8000/v1', api_key='token-abc123', model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct')`\n\n# connecting to a cloud-backed LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).\nllm = LLM(model_url=\"openai/gpt-4o-mini\")  # OpenAI\nllm = LLM(model_url=\"anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\") # Anthropic\nOnPrem.LLM suppports any provider and model supported by the LiteLLM package.\nSee here for more information on local LLM APIs.\nMore information on using OpenAI models specifically with OnPrem.LLM is here.\n\n\nSupplying Parameters to the LLM Backend\nExtra parameters supplied to LLM and LLM.prompt are passed directly to the LLM backend. Parameter names will vary depending on the backend you chose.\nFor instance, with the default llama-cpp backend, the default context window size (n_ctx) is set to 3900 and the default output size (max_tokens) is set 512. Both are configurable parameters to LLM. Increase if you have larger prompts or need longer outputs. Other parameters (e.g., api_key, device_map, etc.) can be supplied directly to LLM and will be routed to the LLM backend or API (e.g., llama-cpp-python, Hugging Face transformers, vLLM, OpenAI, etc.). The max_tokens parameter can also be adjusted on-the-fly by supplying it to LLM.prompt.\nOn the other hand, for Ollama models, context window and output size are controlled by num_ctx and num_predict, respectively.\nWith the Hugging Face transformers, setting the context window size is not needed, but the output size is controlled by the max_new_tokens parameter to LLM.prompt.\n\n\n\nSend Prompts to the LLM to Solve Problems\nThis is an example of few-shot prompting, where we provide an example of what we want the LLM to do.\n\nprompt = \"\"\"Extract the names of people in the supplied sentences.\nSeparate names with commas and place on a single line.\n\n# Example 1:\nSentence: James Gandolfini and Paul Newman were great actors.\nPeople:\nJames Gandolfini, Paul Newman\n\n# Example 2:\nSentence:\nI like Cillian Murphy's acting. Florence Pugh is great, too.\nPeople:\"\"\"\n\nsaved_output = llm.prompt(prompt, stop=['\\n\\n'])\n\n\nCillian Murphy, Florence Pugh\n\n\nAdditional prompt examples are shown here.\n\n\nTalk to Your Documents\nAnswers are generated from the content of your documents (i.e., retrieval augmented generation or RAG). Here, we will use GPU offloading to speed up answer generation using the default model. However, the Zephyr-7B model may perform even better, responds faster, and is used in our RAG example notebook.\n\nfrom onprem import LLM\n\nllm = LLM(n_gpu_layers=-1, store_type='sparse', verbose=False)\n\nllama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx_per_seq (3904) &lt; n_ctx_train (32768) -- the full capacity of the model will not be utilized\n\n\n\nStep 1: Ingest the Documents into a Vector Database\nAs of v0.10.0, you have the option of storing documents in either a dense vector store (i.e., Chroma) or a sparse vector store (i.e., a built-in keyword search index). Sparse vector stores sacrifice a small amount of inference speed for significant improvements in ingestion speed (useful for larger document sets) and also assume answer sources will include at least one word from the question. To select the store type, supply either store_type=\"dense\" or store_type=\"sparse\" when creating the LLM. As you can see above, we use a sparse vector store here.\n\nllm.ingest(\"./tests/sample_data\")\n\nCreating new vectorstore at /home/amaiya/onprem_data/vectordb/sparse\nLoading documents from ./tests/sample_data\n\n\nLoading new documents: 100%|██████████████████████| 6/6 [00:09&lt;00:00,  1.51s/it]\nProcessing and chunking 43 new documents: 100%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 1/1 [00:00&lt;00:00, 116.11it/s]\n\n\nSplit into 354 chunks of text (max. 500 chars each for text; max. 2000 chars for tables)\n\n\n100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 354/354 [00:00&lt;00:00, 2548.70it/s]\n\n\nIngestion complete!

Building Models\nSupervised learning tasks in ktrain follow a standard, easy-to-use template.\nSTEP 1: Load and Preprocess Data. This step involves loading data from diﬀerent\nsources and preprocessing it in a way that is expected by the model. In the case of text,\nthis may involve language-speciﬁc preprocessing (e.g., tokenization). In the case of images,\n\n4.&gt; /home/amaiya/projects/ghub/onprem/nbs/tests/sample_data/ktrain_paper/ktrain_paper.pdf:\nAutoKeras (Jin et al., 2019) and AutoGluon (Erickson et al., 2020) lack some key “pre-\ncanned” features in ktrain, which has the strongest support for natural language processing\nand graph-based data. Support for additional features is planned for the future.\n5. Conclusion\nThis work presented ktrain, a low-code platform for machine learning. ktrain currently in-\ncludes out-of-the-box support for training models on text, vision, graph, and tabular\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract Text from Documents\nThe load_single_document function can extract text from a range of different document formats (e.g., PDFs, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, etc.). It is automatically invoked when calling LLM.ingest. Extracted text is represented as LangChain Document objects, where Document.page_content stores the extracted text and Document.metadata stores any extracted document metadata.\nFor PDFs, in particular, a number of different options are available depending on your use case.\nFast PDF Extraction (default)\n\nPro: Fast\nCon: Does not infer/retain structure of tables in PDF documents\n\n\nfrom onprem.ingest import load_single_document\n\ndocs = load_single_document('tests/sample_data/ktrain_paper/ktrain_paper.pdf')\ndocs[0].metadata\n\n{'source': '/home/amaiya/projects/ghub/onprem/nbs/sample_data/1/ktrain_paper.pdf',\n 'file_path': '/home/amaiya/projects/ghub/onprem/nbs/sample_data/1/ktrain_paper.pdf',\n 'page': 0,\n 'total_pages': 9,\n 'format': 'PDF 1.4',\n 'title': '',\n 'author': '',\n 'subject': '',\n 'keywords': '',\n 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref',\n 'producer': 'dvips + GPL Ghostscript GIT PRERELEASE 9.22',\n 'creationDate': \"D:20220406214054-04'00'\",\n 'modDate': \"D:20220406214054-04'00'\",\n 'trapped': ''}\n\n\nAutomatic OCR of PDFs\n\nPro: Automatically extracts text from scanned PDFs\nCon: Slow\n\nThe load_single_document function will automatically OCR PDFs that require it (i.e., PDFs that are scanned hard-copies of documents). If a document is OCR’ed during extraction, the metadata['ocr'] field will be populated with True.\n\ndocs = load_single_document('tests/sample_data/ocr_document/lynn1975.pdf')\ndocs[0].metadata\n\n{'source': '/home/amaiya/projects/ghub/onprem/nbs/sample_data/4/lynn1975.pdf',\n 'ocr': True}\n\n\nMarkdown Conversion in PDFs\n\nPro: Better chunking for QA\nCon: Slower than default PDF extraction\n\nThe load_single_document function can convert PDFs to Markdown instead of plain text by supplying the pdf_markdown=True as an argument:\ndocs = load_single_document('your_pdf_document.pdf', \n                            pdf_markdown=True)\nConverting to Markdown can facilitate downstream tasks like question-answering. For instance, when supplying pdf_markdown=True to LLM.ingest, documents are chunked in a Markdown-aware fashion (e.g., the abstract of a research paper tends to be kept together into a single chunk instead of being split up). Note that Markdown will not be extracted if the document requires OCR.\nInferring Table Structure in PDFs\n\nPro: Makes it easier for LLMs to analyze information in tables\nCon: Slower than default PDF extraction\n\nWhen supplying infer_table_structure=True to either load_single_document or LLM.ingest, tables are inferred and extracted from PDFs using a TableTransformer model. Tables are represented as Markdown (or HTML if Markdown conversion is not possible).\ndocs = load_single_document('your_pdf_document.pdf', \n                            infer_table_structure=True)\nParsing Extracted Text Into Sentences or Paragraphs\nFor some analyses (e.g., using prompts for information extraction), it may be useful to parse the text extracted from documents into individual sentences or paragraphs. This can be accomplished using the segment function:\n\nfrom onprem.ingest import load_single_document\nfrom onprem.utils import segment\ntext = load_single_document('tests/sample_data/sotu/state_of_the_union.txt')[0].page_content\n\n\nsegment(text, unit='paragraph')[0]\n\n'Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman.  Members of Congress and the Cabinet.  Justices of the Supreme Court.  My fellow Americans.'\n\n\n\nsegment(text, unit='sentence')[0]\n\n'Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman.'\n\n\n\n\nSummarization Pipeline\nSummarize your raw documents (e.g., PDFs, MS Word) with an LLM.\n\nMap-Reduce Summarization\nSummarize each chunk in a document and then generate a single summary from the individual summaries.\n\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm = LLM(n_gpu_layers=-1, verbose=False, mute_stream=True) # disabling viewing of intermediate summarization prompts/inferences\n\n\nfrom onprem.pipelines import Summarizer\nsumm = Summarizer(llm)\n\nresp = summ.summarize('tests/sample_data/ktrain_paper/ktrain_paper.pdf', max_chunks_to_use=5) # omit max_chunks_to_use parameter to consider entire document\nprint(resp['output_text'])\n\n Ktrain is an open-source machine learning library that offers a unified interface for various machine learning tasks. The library supports both supervised and non-supervised machine learning, and includes methods for training models, evaluating models, making predictions on new data, and providing explanations for model decisions. Additionally, the library integrates with various explainable AI libraries such as shap, eli5 with lime, and others to provide more interpretable models.\n\n\n\n\nConcept-Focused Summarization\nSummarize a large document with respect to a particular concept of interest.\n\nfrom onprem import LLM\nfrom onprem.pipelines import Summarizer\n\n\nllm = LLM(default_model='zephyr', n_gpu_layers=-1, verbose=False, temperature=0)\nsumm = Summarizer(llm)\nsummary, sources = summ.summarize_by_concept('tests/sample_data/ktrain_paper/ktrain_paper.pdf', concept_description=\"question answering\")\n\n\nThe context provided describes the implementation of an open-domain question-answering system using ktrain, a low-code library for augmented machine learning. The system follows three main steps: indexing documents into a search engine, locating documents containing words in the question, and extracting candidate answers from those documents using a BERT model pretrained on the SQuAD dataset. Confidence scores are used to sort and prune candidate answers before returning results. The entire workflow can be implemented with only three lines of code using ktrain's SimpleQA module. This system allows for the submission of natural language questions and receives exact answers, as demonstrated in the provided example. Overall, the context highlights the ease and accessibility of building sophisticated machine learning models, including open-domain question-answering systems, through ktrain's low-code interface.\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Extraction Pipeline\nExtract information from raw documents (e.g., PDFs, MS Word documents) with an LLM.\n\nfrom onprem import LLM\nfrom onprem.pipelines import Extractor\n# Notice that we're using a cloud-based, off-premises model here! See \"OpenAI\" section below.\nllm = LLM(model_url='openai://gpt-3.5-turbo', verbose=False, mute_stream=True, temperature=0) \nextractor = Extractor(llm)\nprompt = \"\"\"Extract the names of research institutions (e.g., universities, research labs, corporations, etc.) \nfrom the following sentence delimited by three backticks. If there are no organizations, return NA.  \nIf there are multiple organizations, separate them with commas.\n```{text}```\n\"\"\"\ndf = extractor.apply(prompt, fpath='tests/sample_data/ktrain_paper/ktrain_paper.pdf', pdf_pages=[1], stop=['\\n'])\ndf.loc[df['Extractions'] != 'NA'].Extractions[0]\n\n/home/amaiya/projects/ghub/onprem/onprem/core.py:159: UserWarning: The model you supplied is gpt-3.5-turbo, an external service (i.e., not on-premises). Use with caution, as your data and prompts will be sent externally.\n  warnings.warn(f'The model you supplied is {self.model_name}, an external service (i.e., not on-premises). '+\\\n\n\n'Institute for Defense Analyses'\n\n\n\n\nFew-Shot Classification\nMake accurate text classification predictions using only a tiny number of labeled examples.\n# create classifier\nfrom onprem.pipelines import FewShotClassifier\nclf = FewShotClassifier(use_smaller=True)\n\n# Fetching data\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nclasses = [\"soc.religion.christian\", \"sci.space\"]\nnewsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\"all\", categories=classes)\ncorpus, group_labels = np.array(newsgroups.data), np.array(newsgroups.target_names)[newsgroups.target]\n\n# Wrangling data into a dataframe and selecting training examples\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\"text\": corpus, \"label\": group_labels})\ntrain_df = data.groupby(\"label\").sample(5)\ntest_df = data.drop(index=train_df.index)\n\n# X_sample only contains 5 examples of each class!\nX_sample, y_sample = train_df['text'].values, train_df['label'].values\n\n# test set\nX_test, y_test = test_df['text'].values, test_df['label'].values\n\n# train\nclf.train(X_sample,  y_sample, max_steps=20)\n\n# evaluate\nprint(clf.evaluate(X_test, y_test, print_report=False)['accuracy'])\n#output: 0.98\n\n# make predictions\nclf.predict(['Elon Musk likes launching satellites.']).tolist()[0]\n#output: sci.space\nTIP: You can also easily train a wide range of traditional text classification models using both Hugging Face transformers and scikit-learn as backends.\n\n\nUsing Hugging Face Transformers Instead of Llama.cpp\nBy default, the LLM backend employed by OnPrem.LLM is llama-cpp-python, which requires models in GGUF format. As of v0.5.0, it is now possible to use Hugging Face transformers as the LLM backend instead. This is accomplished by using the model_id parameter (instead of supplying a model_url argument). In the example below, we run the Llama-3.1-8B model.\n# llama-cpp-python does NOT need to be installed when using model_id parameter\nllm = LLM(model_id=\"hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4\", device_map='cuda')\nThis allows you to more easily use any model on the Hugging Face hub in SafeTensors format provided it can be loaded with the Hugging Face transformers.pipeline. Note that, when using the model_id parameter, the prompt_template is set automatically by transformers.\nThe Llama-3.1 model loaded above was quantized using AWQ, which allows the model to fit onto smaller GPUs (e.g., laptop GPUs with 6GB of VRAM) similar to the default GGUF format. AWQ models will require the autoawq package to be installed: pip install autoawq (AWQ only supports Linux system, including Windows Subsystem for Linux). If you do need to load a model that is not quantized, you can supply a quantization configuration at load time (known as “inflight quantization”). In the following example, we load an unquantized Zephyr-7B-beta model that will be quantized during loading to fit on GPUs with as little as 6GB of VRAM:\nfrom transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n    load_in_4bit=True,\n    bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",\n    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=\"float16\",\n    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,\n)\nllm = LLM(model_id=\"HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta\", device_map='cuda', \n          model_kwargs={\"quantization_config\":quantization_config})\nWhen supplying a quantization_config, the bitsandbytes library, a lightweight Python wrapper around CUDA custom functions, in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()), and 8 & 4-bit quantization functions, is used. There are ongoing efforts by the bitsandbytes team to support multiple backends in addition to CUDA. If you receive errors related to bitsandbytes, please refer to the bitsandbytes documentation.\n\n\nConnecting to LLMs Served Through REST APIs\nOnPrem.LLM can be used with LLMs being served through any OpenAI-compatible REST API. This means you can easily use OnPrem.LLM with tools like vLLM, OpenLLM, Ollama, and the llama.cpp server.\n\nvLLM Example\nFor instance, using vLLM, you can serve an LLM as follows (replace the --model argument with model you want to use):\npython -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --dtype auto --api-key token-abc123\nYou can then connect OnPrem.LLM to the LLM by supplying the URL of the server you just started:\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm = LLM(model_url='http://localhost:8000/v1', api_key='token-abc123', model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct') \n# Note: The API key can either be supplied directly or stored in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\n#       If the server does not require an API key, `api_key` should still be supplied with a dummy value like 'na'.\n#       The model argument must exactly match what was supplied when starting the vLLM server.\nThat’s it! Solve problems with OnPrem.LLM as you normally would (e.g., RAG question-answering, summarization, few-shot prompting, code generation, etc.).\n\n\nOllama Example\nAfter downloading and installing Ollama and pulling a model (eg., ollama pull llama3.2), you can use it in OnPrem.LLM as follows:\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm = LLM(model_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='NA', model='llama3.2')\noutput = llm.prompt('What is the capital of France?')\n\n# OUTPUT:\n# The capital of France is Paris.\nIf using OnPrem.LLM with Ollama or vLLM, then llama-cpp-python does not need to be installed.\n\n\n\nUsing OpenAI Models with OnPrem.LLM\nEven when using on-premises language models, it can sometimes be useful to have easy access to non-local, cloud-based models (e.g., OpenAI) for testing, producing baselines for comparison, and generating synthetic examples for fine-tuning. For these reasons, in spite of the name, OnPrem.LLM now includes support for OpenAI chat models:\n\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm = LLM(model_url='openai://gpt-4o', temperature=0)\n\n/home/amaiya/projects/ghub/onprem/onprem/core.py:196: UserWarning: The model you supplied is gpt-4o, an external service (i.e., not on-premises). Use with caution, as your data and prompts will be sent externally.\n  warnings.warn(f'The model you supplied is {self.model_name}, an external service (i.e., not on-premises). '+\\\n\n\nThis OpenAI LLM instance can now be used for most features in OnPrem.LLM (e.g., RAG, information extraction, summarization, etc.). Here we simply use it for general prompting:\n\nsaved_result = llm.prompt('List three cute  names for a cat and explain why each is cute.')\n\nCertainly! Here are three cute names for a cat, along with explanations for why each is adorable:\n\n1. **Whiskers**: This name is cute because it highlights one of the most distinctive and charming features of a cat—their whiskers. It's playful and endearing, evoking the image of a curious cat twitching its whiskers as it explores its surroundings.\n\n2. **Mittens**: This name is cute because it conjures up the image of a cat with little white paws that look like they are wearing mittens. It's a cozy and affectionate name that suggests warmth and cuddliness, much like a pair of soft mittens.\n\n3. **Pumpkin**: This name is cute because it brings to mind the warm, orange hues of a pumpkin, which can be reminiscent of certain cat fur colors. It's also associated with the fall season, which is often linked to comfort and coziness. Plus, the name \"Pumpkin\" has a sweet and affectionate ring to it, making it perfect for a beloved pet.\n\n\nUsing Vision Capabilities in GPT-4o\n\nimage_url = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg\"\nsaved_result = llm.prompt('Describe the weather in this image.', image_path_or_url=image_url)\n\nThe weather in the image appears to be clear and sunny. The sky is mostly blue with some scattered clouds, suggesting a pleasant day with good visibility. The sunlight is bright, illuminating the green grass and landscape.\n\n\nUsing OpenAI-Style Message Dictionaries\n\nmessages = [\n    {'content': [{'text': 'describe the weather in this image', \n                  'type': 'text'},\n                 {'image_url': {'url': image_url},\n                  'type': 'image_url'}],\n     'role': 'user'}]\nsaved_result = llm.prompt(messages)\n\nThe weather in the image appears to be clear and sunny. The sky is mostly blue with some scattered clouds, suggesting a pleasant day with good visibility. The sunlight is bright, casting clear shadows and illuminating the green landscape.\n\n\nAzure OpenAI\nFor Azure OpenAI models, use the following URL format:\nllm = LLM(model_url='azure://&lt;deployment_name&gt;', ...) \n# &lt;deployment_name&gt; is the Azure deployment name and additional Azure-specific parameters \n# can be supplied as extra arguments to LLM (or set as environment variables)\n\n\nStructured and Guided Outputs\nThe LLM.pydantic_prompt method allows you to specify the desired structure of the LLM’s output as a Pydantic model.\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass Joke(BaseModel):\n    setup: str = Field(description=\"question to set up a joke\")\n    punchline: str = Field(description=\"answer to resolve the joke\")\n\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm = LLM(default_model='llama', verbose=False)\nstructured_output = llm.pydantic_prompt('Tell me a joke.', pydantic_model=Joke)\n\nllama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx_per_seq (3904) &lt; n_ctx_train (131072) -- the full capacity of the model will not be utilized\n\n\n{\n  \"setup\": \"Why couldn't the bicycle stand alone?\",\n  \"punchline\": \"Because it was two-tired!\"\n}\n\n\nThe output is a Pydantic object instead of a string:\n\nstructured_output\n\nJoke(setup=\"Why couldn't the bicycle stand alone?\", punchline='Because it was two-tired!')\n\n\n\nprint(structured_output.setup)\nprint()\nprint(structured_output.punchline)\n\nWhy couldn't the bicycle stand alone?\n\nBecause it was two-tired!\n\n\nYou can also use OnPrem.LLM with the Guidance package to guide the LLM to generate outputs based on your conditions and constraints. We’ll show a couple of examples here, but see our documentation on guided prompts for more information.\n\nfrom onprem import LLM\n\nllm = LLM(n_gpu_layers=-1, verbose=False)\nfrom onprem.pipelines.guider import Guider\nguider = Guider(llm)\n\nWith the Guider, you can use use Regular Expressions to control LLM generation:\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"Question: Luke has ten balls. He gives three to his brother. How many balls does he have left?\nAnswer: \"\"\" + gen(name='answer', regex='\\d+')\n\nguider.prompt(prompt, echo=False)\n\n{'answer': '7'}\n\n\n\nprompt = '19, 18,' + gen(name='output', max_tokens=50, stop_regex='[^\\d]7[^\\d]')\nguider.prompt(prompt)\n\n19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8,\n\n\n{'output': ' 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8,'}\n\n\nSee the documentation for more examples of how to use Guidance with OnPrem.LLM.",

    "text": "FAQ\n\nHow do I use other models with OnPrem.LLM?\n\nYou can supply any model of your choice using the model_url and model_id parameters to LLM (see cheat sheet above).\n\n\nHere, we will go into detail on how to supply a custom GGUF model using the llma.cpp backend.\n\n\nYou can find llama.cpp-supported models with GGUF in the file name on huggingface.co.\n\n\nMake sure you are pointing to the URL of the actual GGUF model file, which is the “download” link on the model’s page. An example for Mistral-7B is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the llama.cpp backend, GGUF models have specific prompt formats that need to supplied to LLM. For instance, the prompt template required for Zephyr-7B, as described on the model’s page, is:\n&lt;|system|&gt;\\n&lt;/s&gt;\\n&lt;|user|&gt;\\n{prompt}&lt;/s&gt;\\n&lt;|assistant|&gt;\nSo, to use the Zephyr-7B model, you must supply the prompt_template argument to the LLM constructor (or specify it in the webapp.yml configuration for the Web app).\n# how to use Zephyr-7B with OnPrem.LLM\nllm = LLM(model_url='https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GGUF/resolve/main/zephyr-7b-beta.Q4_K_M.gguf',\n          prompt_template = \"&lt;|system|&gt;\\n&lt;/s&gt;\\n&lt;|user|&gt;\\n{prompt}&lt;/s&gt;\\n&lt;|assistant|&gt;\",\n          n_gpu_layers=33)\nllm.prompt(\"List three cute names for a cat.\")\n\n\nPrompt templates are not required for any other LLM backend (e.g., when using Ollama as backend or when using model_id parameter for transformers models). Prompt templates are also not required if using any of the default models.\n\nWhen installing onprem, I’m getting “build” errors related to llama-cpp-python (or chroma-hnswlib) on Windows/Mac/Linux?\n\nSee this LangChain documentation on LLama.cpp for help on installing the llama-cpp-python package for your system. Additional tips for different operating systems are shown below:\n\n\nFor Linux systems like Ubuntu, try this: sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ clang. Other tips are here.\n\n\nFor Windows systems, please try following these instructions. We recommend you use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instead of using Microsoft Windows directly. If you do need to use Microsoft Window directly, be sure to install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools and make sure the Desktop development with C++ is selected.\n\n\nFor Macs, try following these tips.\n\n\nThere are also various other tips for each of the above OSes in this privateGPT repo thread. Of course, you can also easily use OnPrem.LLM on Google Colab.\n\n\nFinally, if you still can’t overcome issues with building llama-cpp-python, you can try installing the pre-built wheel file for your system:\n\n\nExample: pip install llama-cpp-python==0.2.90 --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cpu\nTip: There are pre-built wheel files for chroma-hnswlib, as well. If running pip install onprem fails on building chroma-hnswlib, it may be because a pre-built wheel doesn’t yet exist for the version of Python you’re using (in which case you can try downgrading Python).\n\nI’m behind a corporate firewall and am receiving an SSL error when trying to download the model?\n\nTry this:\nfrom onprem import LLM\nLLM.download_model(url, ssl_verify=False)\n\n\nYou can download the embedding model (used by LLM.ingest and LLM.ask) as follows:\nwget --no-check-certificate https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/reimers/sentence-transformers/v0.2/all-MiniLM-L6-v2.zip\n\n\nSupply the unzipped folder name as the embedding_model_name argument to LLM.\n\n\nIf you’re getting SSL errors when even running pip install, try this:\npip install –-trusted-host pypi.org –-trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org pip_system_certs\n\nHow do I use this on a machine with no internet access?\n\nUse the LLM.download_model method to download the model files to &lt;your_home_directory&gt;/onprem_data and transfer them to the same location on the air-gapped machine.\n\n\nFor the ingest and ask methods, you will need to also download and transfer the embedding model files:\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\nmodel.save('/some/folder')\n\n\nCopy the some/folder folder to the air-gapped machine and supply the path to LLM via the embedding_model_name parameter.\n\nMy model is not loading when I call llm = LLM(...)?\n\nThis can happen if the model file is corrupt (in which case you should delete from &lt;home directory&gt;/onprem_data and re-download). It can also happen if the version of llama-cpp-python needs to be upgraded to the latest.\n\nI’m getting an “Illegal instruction (core dumped) error when instantiating a langchain.llms.Llamacpp or onprem.LLM object?\n\nYour CPU may not support instructions that cmake is using for one reason or another (e.g., due to Hyper-V in VirtualBox settings). You can try turning them off when building and installing llama-cpp-python:\n\n\n# example\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_AVX2=OFF -DGGML_AVX=OFF -DGGML_F16C=OFF -DGGML_FMA=OFF\" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install --force-reinstall llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir\n\nHow can I speed up LLM.ingest?\n\nBy default, a GPU, if available, will be used to compute embeddings, so ensure PyTorch is installed with GPU support. You can explicitly control the device used for computing embeddings with the embedding_model_kwargs argument.\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm  = LLM(embedding_model_kwargs={'device':'cuda'})\n\n\nYou can also supply store_type=\"sparse\" to LLM to use a sparse vector store, which sacrifices a small amount of inference speed (LLM.ask) for significant speed ups during ingestion (LLM.ingest).\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm  = LLM(store_type=\"sparse\")\nNote, however, that, unlike dense vector stores, sparse vector stores assume answer sources will contain at least one word in common with the question.",

For instance, ollama/llama3.2 is a 3B-parameter model and not recommended. In this example, we will use ollama/llama3.1:8b and repeat one of the earlier examples from above. The example below assumes you have already installed Ollama and pulled the Llama3.1:8b model with ollama pull llama3.1:8b.\nImportant Note: If using a local model, it is important to set the context window to a higher value (e.g., 8192) to support agentic workflows.\n\nFor the llama.cpp backend, supply n_ctx=8192 as a parameter to LLM.\nFor the Ollama backend, supply num_ctx=8192 as a parameter to LLM.\nFor the Hugging Face transformers backend (e.g., LLM(model_id='hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4', device='cuda'), context window is set automatically, so no extra parameters are necessary.\n\n\nfrom onprem import LLM\nfrom onprem.pipelines import Agent\nllm = LLM(\"ollama/llama3.1:8b\", mute_stream=True, num_ctx=8182) \n\nagent = Agent(llm)\nagent.add_webview_tool()\nanswer = agent.run(\"What is the highest level of education of the person listed on this page: https://arun.maiya.net?\")\n\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────── New run ────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│                                                                                                                 │\n│ What is the highest level of education of the person listed on this page: https://arun.maiya.net?               │\n│                                                                                                                 │\n╰─ AgentModel - None ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Step 1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n\n\n╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│ Calling tool: 'visit_webpage' with arguments: {'url': 'https://arun.maiya.net'}                                 │\n╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n\n\n\nObservations: Arun S.

My research broadly focuses on the study of computational methods to *extract meaning \nfrom raw data* and includes the areas of natural language processing, machine learning, data mining, computer \nvision, and network science (e.g., social network analysis). I like building tools to make machine learning easier \nto apply in new ways and new areas. Through my work, I have contributed to national-level strategic-planning \nactivities and R&D roadmaps. I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the |Laboratory for Computational \nPopulation Biology](http://compbio.cs.uic.edu/), which is within the |Department of Computer \nScience](http://www.cs.uic.edu/) at the\n|University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)](http://www.uic.edu/).

    "text": "Basic RAG\n\nSTEP 1: Setup the LLM instance\nIn this first example, we will use a model called Zephyr-7B-beta. When selecting a model, it is important to inspect the model’s home page and identify the correct prompt format. The prompt format for this model is located here, and we will supply it directly to the LLM constructor along with the URL to the specific model file we want (i.e., zephyr-7b-beta.Q4_K_M.gguf). We will offload layers to our GPU(s) to speed up inference using the n_gpu_layers parameter. (For more information on GPU acceleration, see here.) For the purposes of this notebook, we also supply temperature=0 so that there is no variability in outputs. You can increase this value for more creativity in the outputs. Finally, we will choose a non-default location for our vector database.\n\nfrom onprem import LLM, utils as U\nimport tempfile\nfrom textwrap import wrap\n\n\nvectordb_path = tempfile.mkdtemp()\n\nllm = LLM(model_url='https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GGUF/resolve/main/zephyr-7b-beta.Q4_K_M.gguf', \n          prompt_template= \"&lt;|system|&gt;\\n&lt;/s&gt;\\n&lt;|user|&gt;\\n{prompt}&lt;/s&gt;\\n&lt;|assistant|&gt;\",\n          n_gpu_layers=-1,\n          temperature=0,\n          store_type='dense',\n          vectordb_path=vectordb_path,\n         verbose=False)\n\nllama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx_per_seq (3904) &lt; n_ctx_train (32768) -- the full capacity of the model will not be utilized\n\n\nSince OnPrem.LLM includes built-in support for Zephyr, an easier way to instantiate the LLM with Zephyr is as follows:\nllm = LLM(default_model='zephyr', \n          n_gpu_layers=-1,\n          temperature=0,\n          store_type='dense',\n          vectordb_path=vectordb_path)\n\n\nSTEP 2: Ingest Documents\nWhen ingesting documents, they can be stored in one of two ways: 1. a dense vector store: a conventional vector database like Chroma 2. a sparse vector store: a keyword-search engine\nSparse vector stores compute embeddings on-the-fly at inference time. As a result, sparse vector stores sacrifice a small amount of inference speed for significant speed ups in ingestion speed. This makes it better suited for larger document sets. Note that sparse vector stores include the contraint that any passages considered as sources for answers should have at least one word in common with the question being asked. You can specify the kind of vector store by supplying either store_type=\"dense\" or store_type=\"sparse\" when creating the LLM above. We use a dense vector store in this example, as shown above.\nFor this example, we will download the 2024 National Defense Autorization Act (NDAA) report and ingest it.\n\nU.download('https://www.congress.gov/118/crpt/hrpt125/CRPT-118hrpt125.pdf', '/tmp/ndaa/ndaa.pdf', verify=True)\n\n[██████████████████████████████████████████████████]\n\n\n\nllm.ingest(\"/tmp/ndaa/\")\n\nCreating new vectorstore at /tmp/tmpmnt6g6l8/dense\nLoading documents from /tmp/ndaa/\n\n\nLoading new documents: 100%|██████████████████████| 1/1 [00:00&lt;00:00,  1.62it/s]\nProcessing and chunking 672 new documents: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 1/1 [00:00&lt;00:00, 10.22it/s]\n\n\nSplit into 5202 chunks of text (max. 500 chars each for text; max. 2000 chars for tables)\nCreating embeddings.

    "text": "Advanced Example: NSF Awards\nThe example above employed the use of the default dense vector store, Chroma. By supplying store_type=\"sparse\" to LLM, a sparse vector store (i.e., keyword search engine) is used instead. Sparse vector stores index documents faster but requires keyword matches between sources containing answers and the question or query. Semantic search is still supported through on-demand dense vectorization in OnPrem.LLM.\nIn this example, we will instantiate a spare store directly and customize the ingestion process to include custom fields using a dataset of 2024 NSF Awards.\n\nSTEP 1: Download the Pre-Process the NSF Data\nNSF awards data stores as thousands of JSON files.

This is equivalent to supplying store_type=\"sparse\" to LLM. However, we will explicitly create the SparseStore instance to customize the ingestion process for NSF data.\nSince award abstracts are not lengthy, we will forgo chunking the document (e.g., using either onprem.ingest.chunk_documents or another chunking tool like chonkie) and instead store each award as a single record in the index.\n\nfrom onprem.ingest import VectorStoreFactory, helpers, chunk_documents\nstore = VectorStoreFactory.create(\n    kind='whoosh',\n    persist_location='/tmp/nsf_store'\n)\n\n\ndocs = []\nfor d in nsf_data:\n    doc = helpers.doc_from_dict(d, content_field='abstract')\n    docs.append(doc)\nstore.add_documents(docs)\n\n100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 11687/11687 [00:10&lt;00:00, 1119.63it/s]\n\n\nLet’s examine the total number of awards stored.\n\nstore.get_size()\n\n11687\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: Explore NSF Awards\nWe can explore NSF awards by either using an LLM or querying the vector store directly.\nThe NSF buckets awards into different catgories. Let’s examine all the material-related categories.\n\nset([d['category'] for d in store.search('category:*material*', limit=100)['hits']])\n\n{'BIOMATERIALS PROGRAM',\n 'ELECTRONIC/PHOTONIC MATERIALS',\n 'Mechanics of Materials and Str',\n 'SOLID STATE & MATERIALS CHEMIS'}\n\n\nLet’s see how many of the material-related awards mention AI.\nOne of the advantages of sparse vector stores is the ability to easily use complex boolean queries to target specific documents.\n\nstore.search('(\"machine learning\" OR \"artificial intelligence\") AND category:*material*', limit=100)['total_hits']\n\n15\n\n\nWe wil now use an LLM to summarize how AI is utilized in this research.\nSince NSF awards data are publicly-available, we will use OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini, a cloud LLM.\n\nfrom onprem import LLM\nllm = LLM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')\nllm.load_vectorstore(custom_vectorstore=store)\nresult = llm.ask('How is articial intelligene and machine learning used in these research projects?', \n                 limit=16,\n                  where_document='(\"machine learning\" OR \"artificial intelligence\") AND category:*material*')\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are utilized in various research projects described in the provided context in several ways:\n\n1. **Data-Driven Approaches**: Many projects leverage AI techniques to analyze complex datasets and identify patterns that are not easily discernible through traditional methods. For example, in the project on engineered photonic materials, AI is used to develop new materials with tailored properties by consolidating information on material compositions and geometries.\n\n2. **Model Development and Prediction**: AI and ML are employed to create predictive models that can simulate the behavior of materials under different conditions. The project on recycled polymers utilizes AI to predict deformation and failure mechanisms in recyclates, enhancing their mechanical performance.\n\n3. **Optimization**: Machine learning algorithms are used for optimizing the design and synthesis processes of materials. In the project focused on luminescent biomaterials, iterative Bayesian optimization is applied to screen proteins for desired luminescent properties, facilitating the discovery of new materials.\n\n4. **Enhanced Characterization**: In the study of nanofibers, machine learning aids in understanding and mitigating defects that compromise strength by predicting stress fields around nanovoids and assessing the impact of atomic crosslinks on material properties.\n\n5. **Multiscale Simulations**: AI enhances multiscale modeling approaches, where simulations at different scales (from atomic to macro) are integrated to provide insights into material performance. For instance, the project on 3D printed polymer composites combines computational modeling with experimental data to understand fracture mechanisms.\n\n6. **Education and Workforce Development**: Several projects include educational components that involve teaching AI and ML techniques to students from diverse backgrounds, thereby preparing the next generation of engineers and scientists with skills relevant to emerging technologies.\n\nOverall, AI and ML are essential tools in these projects, facilitating advancements in material science, improving predictive capabilities, and enhancing the understanding of complex physical phenomena.\n\n\nAwards used to answer the question are shown below.\n\nfor d in result['source_documents']:\n    print(d.metadata['title'])\n\nConference: Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning Integrated Physics Modeling (UQ-MLIP 2024); Arlington, Virginia; 12-14 August 2024\nCollaborative Research: DMREF: Accelerating the Design and Development of Engineered Photonic Materials based on a Data-Driven Deep Learning Approach\nCollaborative Research: DMREF: Accelerating the Design and Development of Engineered Photonic Materials based on a Data-Driven Deep Learning Approach\nEAGER: Generative AI for Learning Emergent Complexity in  Mechanics-driven Coupled Physics Problems\nCAREER: Investigating the Role of Microstructure in the High Strain Rate Behavior of Stable Nanocrystalline Alloys\nConference: 10th International Conference on Spectroscopic Ellipsometry\nCAREER: Informed Testing — From Full-Field Characterization of Mechanically Graded Soft Materials to Student Equity in the Classroom\n2024 Solid State Chemistry Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar\nDesigning Luminescent Biomaterials from First Principles\nCAREER: Recycled Polymers of Enhanced Strength and Toughness: Predicting Failure and Unraveling Deformation to Enable Circular Transitions\nCollaborative Research: DMREF: Organic Materials Architectured for Researching Vibronic Excitations with Light in the Infrared (MARVEL-IR)\nDesigning Pyrolyzed Nanofibers at the Atomic Level: Toward Synthesis of Ultra-high-strength Nano-carbon\nCAREER: Design and synthesis of functional van der Waals magnets\nIntegrated Multiscale Computational and Experimental Investigations on Fracture of Additively Manufactured Polymer Composites",

I found this in manuscripts, this is the “Budapest Kabbalah Theory of the Nineteen Twenties”. It sounds an innovation, but is very simple. 4. There are Cycles. In each Hundred Years we only look at two Constellations – Jubilee Years from the Bible - from among the Kings who hav had an impact on our Ancestors. This is the basic idea of the List I have found. It is based on the Biblical 50 years the Yobel Cycles. 5. Hence we do have four Decades (with 12 ys). There exist statistics about Bank-Cycles and also about the psychological differences of the Four Phases. This psychological cycle theory was presented in the Eighties by Lloyd deMause, who analyzed the differing cartoon motives of the four different years of American presidents. He found archtypes – Body Parts, Family Members – like Jung and Bowlby in their theories in the 1930s and 1950s. And this can be projected to the Four Decades of a messianic Yobel Year, of the 45-50 years (when price cycles restart five years before the fulfillment of the half century). 6.To further filter the countless events in history, we only look at religious fightings: non-Jewish David-House legends in Kingly families (like the Habsburgs, Bourbons who have had Hungarian-Polish Szapolyai ancestors (these are 2 facts that are not wel-known) 7. It is also not well-known, that in every generation there are Jewish Rabbis, who are considered to stem from the Davidic Line – potential Meshiahs. 8.

Where they don’t possess such data already, it can be gathered.\n\n\n7\nPUBLIC GOOD\nthe use of AI for public good\nThat is, neither the public nor the private sectors have the analysts necessary to process all the data generated by our cities, and we cannot rely on hard-coded rules to automate the analyses and tell us when things are going wrong (send a notification when more than X number of white vans cross Y bridge), because the nature of events often changes faster than new hard-coded rules can be written.\n\n\n8\nPUBLIC GOOD\nthe use of AI for public good\nOne of the great applications of deep artificial neural networks, the algorithms responsible for many recent advances in artificial intelligence, is anomaly detection. Exposed to large datasets, those neural networks are capable of understanding and modeling normal behavior – reconstructing what should happen – and therefore of identifying outliers and anomalies. They do so without hard-coded rules, and the anomalies they detect can occur across multiple dimensions, changing from day to day as the neural nets are exposed to more data.\n\n\n9\nPUBLIC GOOD\nthe use of AI for public good\nThat is, deep neural networks can perform anomaly detection that keeps pace with rapidly changing patterns in the real world. This capacity to detect new anomalies is causing a shift in fraud detection practices in financial services, and cybersecurity in data centers; it is equally relevant to the governance of urban systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf[df.topic == 'ECONOMIC'].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntopic\ndescription\nresponse\n\n\n\n\n14\nECONOMIC\nthe social and economic implications of AI\nBecause an algorithm can be trained on many more instances of data – say, X-rays of cancer patients – than a healthcare professional can be exposed to in a single lifetime, an algorithm may perceive signals, subtle signs of a tumor, that a human would overlook.\n\n\n21\nECONOMIC\nthe social and economic implications of AI\nThe social and economic implications of AI\n\n\n22\nECONOMIC\nthe social and economic implications of AI\nAs AI advances and its breakthroughs are implemented by large organizations more widely, its impact on society will grow. The scale of that impact may well rival the steam engine or electricity.\n\n\n23\nECONOMIC\nthe social and economic implications of AI\nOn the one hand, we will more efficiently and accurately process information in ways that help individuals and society; on the other, the labor market will be affected, skill sets will be made obsolete, and power and wealth will further shift to those best able to collect, interpret and act on massive amounts of data quickly.\n\n\n24\nECONOMIC\nthe social and economic implications of AI\nDeep technological changes will throw people out of work, reshape communities, and alter the way society behaves, connects and communicates collectively. The automation of trucking through driverless vehicles, for example, will affect America’s 3.5 million truckers and the more than 5 million auxiliary positions related to trucking.

Our own AI programs are routinely mopping the floor with our best fighter pilots in test scenarios. Thats some incredibly advanced programming right there.

If we look at the Ten Spheres as Ten Generations of Ancestors,(as the Zohar advices and as those Miracle Rabbis who prepared themselves to become the Meshiah and watched the Other Side Kings -robbers and killers – who degraded their davidic ancestry) then we are able to look for the Bad Behaviors (and its therapies) as Ancestral Voices. Hence we can help our descendants in the Future. This week we have (by the Bible Melody’s ancestral contemporary stress) in 1709 Intellect Sphere in the Kabbalah - (Queen Anne and Louis XIV with Lully operas (Body Parts Correspondences: Mother,Ear) as it tries to work with the Kindness Sphere in 1754 (Frederic the Second of Prussia) on the Gevura-Strict Judgement Degree (Napoleon-Junot- Puységur and Beethoven) which will eventually impact the Malkuth (Ownership, Ego- Sister) level in 1979 (present in the next week)that has the Mountbatten assassination (Mother raising the Back to the Chest: to Tiferet-Recovery Sphere which will be full in 2024. This theory is a mosaic from facts. Which exists even if no one states it. I am just mixing a few very simply thing. 1. Inherited hormonal stresses exist. We all do know that there are experiments with mice on it. 2. Music is diminishing stress hormones. We all do know that, we even use it in Malls where we influence people by constant music /knowing addicts and criminals hate music/. 3. here is a method to filter our ancestral stresses (as there are millions of ancestors with their traumas: how to choose?) It will be especially important when we\n\n\n42\nMULTIDISCIPLINARY\nthe specific steps that could be taken by the federal government, research institutes, universities, and philanthropies to encourage multi-disciplinary AI research;\nwhen many thousands do sing a melody, it has a stress-diminishing effect in the whole area - there are experiments to prove it.) 10. The List of Dates can be used to find dates in the Future in every 45 years. We do know that scientists work to make resurrection possible. So we can simply understand the picture I found in the manucript about this Future Mashiah who heals Resurrected Kings with melodies and by touching the /hurt/ Body Parts.(It is an archetype in many religious groupings) 11. The Kabalah is an interpretation method for the Bible that uses Body Parts’ Fantasies and so we can find fantasies about Body Parts that are arising in the heads of the List’s non-Jewish and Jewish Leaders while they read the Bible Weekly Portion or they watch Operas. 12. So we are actually able to see into the Future. 13. There exists a theory that claims (Russell Hendel) that the Bible depicts not the Creator of the Physical World, but the Creation of the Visions or Dreams and Prophecies, an Inner World. This is an old teaching – called Gnosticism or Sufi or Kabbalah or Therapy Heretic Wisdom – from which Freud has developed his own theory. Of course these 3 Ideas are disturbingly innovative and together they sem to be complex or even complicated. But they have fusion points. Like I am seeing an arm of someone in my dream. If the weekly melody is evoking 1844 among the everpresent 12 Constellation Dates and this corresponds to opera X (now it is Verd’si Hernani) we look for this item – the Arm that belongs to the Breast among the 4 main Parts and this week indeed we read about the Breast-Plate , the Urim and Tumim, that has a Future redicting capacity. So we must look around the stresses of this date of 1844 and then we can imagine in the Future, when the Messiah heals the Ressurected Leaders, and we see how Meternich is in Therapy because he wanted to pay someone to kill Kossuth (a rebel leader in Hungary) in this year.

But, of course, they are the ones who will be at the top when these changes come. They also have no training in economics, political science, or the social sciences, and think technology is a panacea. The focus on STEM to the detriment of well- rounded, liberal education has left our AI elite dangerously ignorant of the history of the negative effects of technology, and dangerously unimaginative with regard to potential the long-term consequences of their actions. What we need right now is some serious thought about the implications of AI for the structure of society, and what our options are as we transition into this new age. This means interdisciplinary research at the intersection of the social sciences and AI, with serious engagement (and hence funding) of social science scholars.\n\n\n62\nMULTIDISCIPLINARY\nthe specific steps that could be taken by the federal government, research institutes, universities, and philanthropies to encourage multi-disciplinary AI research\ncan benefit from adopting methods and ideas from more established fields of science, namely Cybersecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf[df.topic == 'TRAINING'].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntopic\ndescription\nresponse\n\n\n\n\n90\nTRAINING\nthe scientific and technical training that will be needed to take advantage of harnessing the potential of AI technology, and the challenges faced by institutions of higher education in retaining faculty and responding to explosive growth in student enrollment in AI-related courses and courses of study;\n9.

A good teacher (and a good parent) can do that, but they cannot always be available. A kid in Kansas who wants to be an aerospace engineer should get to try out designing airplanes. But a mentor would be needed. We can build AI mentors in limited domains so it would be possible for a student anywhere to learn to do anything because the AI mentor would understand what a user was trying to accomplish within the domain and perhaps is struggling with. The student could ask questions and expect good answers tailored to the student’s needs because the AI/NLU mentor would know exactly what the students was trying to do because it has a perfect model of the world in which the student was working, the relevant expertise needed, and the mistakes students often make. NLU gets much easier when there is deep domain knowledge available.\n\n\n114\nTRAINING\nthe scientific and technical training that will be needed to take advantage of harnessing the potential of AI technology, and the challenges faced by institutions of higher education in retaining faculty and responding to explosive growth in student enrollment in AI-related courses and courses of study;\n(7) the scientific and technical training that will be needed to take advantage of harnessing the potential of AI technology, and the challenges faced by institutions of higher education in retaining faculty and responding to explosive growth in student enrollment in AI-related courses and courses of study;\n\n\n115\nTRAINING\nthe scientific and technical training that will be needed to take advantage of harnessing the potential of AI technology, and the challenges faced by institutions of higher education in retaining faculty and responding to explosive growth in student enrollment in AI-related courses and courses of study;\n--&gt; Computational thinking courses as general education and computer science options in K12.

[2] Roadmaps should be adjusted for early developments due to large federal funding. [3] Successful industry models should be followed. For example, MITRE, an FFRDC, has initiatives of this kind underway. (Industry, FFRDCs) c. Universities: Already behind the technological curve, universities must retool to absorb faculty and students wanting to be part of the AI evolution. [1] The retooling must be vertical (entry-to-Ph.D. AI tracks). [2] The retooling must also be horizontal (cross- disciplinary and new-disciplinary). [3] Internal grants with contingency funding should anticipate external grants in the near term. [4] Industry partnerships should be started early. [5] Successful models should be followed for efficiency. Some small private colleges have integrating initiatives and programs underway that larger institutions can combine with AI and use as a template. (Academia, Industry) d. Philanthropies: The most promising non-governmental entities for extension of AI to the benefit masses should find ways to refocus their efforts on making AI available to the common man. This goes well beyond formatted, deterministic computer-based-training (CBT). AI is the only tool capable of training its human and AI users on the fly.

As indicated in topic 5 above, AI has tended to shy away from high-level human cognitive processes regarding integrative complex perception, consciousness, and creativity much in part to their seemingly impenetrable complexity. These mind/brain processes constitute a huge gap in AI because machines cannot autonomously and spontaneously perceive, be conscious, and create in response to its environment; they do not have the ability to take information, process it, and act on it in some way that results in an output to the system much like humans do (from daily language use to the creation of artworks). Humans use their senses, emotion, movement, motor responses, and linguistic capabilities to act in response to their surrounding environment through visual, audial, olfactory, tactile and gustatory stimuli. Thus, research on perception in the context of multidisciplinary approaches using both Science and the Arts is fundamental to understanding human perception. The Arts offer a uniquely human platform from which to probe deeper into how emotion, language, decision-making, and creative behaviors all interact in any given moment, whether short-term or durative and/or improvisatory or deliberate. Similarly, consciousness is the human state of being aware of an external something within oneself. The human mind/brain has the ability to experience or to feel a sense of self on any given moment. While arousal levels, responsiveness and patient self-reporting narratives have been used in a medical context to understand consciousness, there is no financial support for those doing out-of-the-box research at the multidisciplinary level using both integrative methods from the Sciences and the Arts. Finally, if the creative process is not understood, machines and robots will never be truly creative. An essential aspect of being creative is the ability to make both old and new\n\n\n364\nRESEARCH GAPS\nthe most important research gaps in AI that must be addressed to advance this field and benefit the public;\n(6) - Among the points listed in (5) advances in verification and quality assurance may be the most important in use cases where AI software can cause damage. - Human-computer interaction is another important area. Bad interaction can result in accidents due to miscommunication with the machine. Another issue is that machine learning results may be incorrectly interpreted by the human operator or the operator may use inappropriate parameters. - AI will continue to improve in other areas, but the progress in these areas is not a limiting factor in the deployment of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf[df.topic == 'DATA'].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntopic\ndescription\nresponse\n\n\n\n\n4\nDATA\nspecific training data sets that can accelerate the development of AI and its application\nSuch datasets are a tremendous help when applying learning algorithms to predict breakdowns and system failures.

One emerging domain of research related to this broader question is in adversarial machine learning (AML). Attacks on machine learning algorithms can come, roughly, in two forms: evasion and poisoning. An evasion attack is best explained using a spam filtering example. Suppose that we have trained a classifier on data to distinguish spam from non-spam. Spammers would subsequently be motivated to modify spam instances in order to be (mis)classified as benign (that is, to evade detection). More generally, in an evasion attack, an attacker wishes to manipulate malicious instances in order to avoid detection by fixed learning algorithms (typically, binary classifiers in such domains). Poisoning attacks are different: in these, the adversary is assumed to modify the training data set itself, so as to subvert the learning algorithms. Poisoning attacks may have goals ranging from degrading observed performance of learning algorithms (the so-called availability attacks) to allowing future adversarial behavior to bypass detection. Given the importance of machine learning algorithms both in research and commercial application, consideration of such attacks on machine learning algorithms may be one of the most significant emerging research problems today. Respondent 72 Dennis Cooper, Self I have some comments regarding item #9 \"specific training sets that can accelerate the development of AI and its application.\" It is absolutely crucial that large training sets be created and maintained by a third party.

In the hardest-hit sectors, workers, families and communities will suffer and break down. Unemployment, drug use and suicides will go up, along with political instability. Policies such as “basic income” or the Danish “flexicurity” should be explored as ways to soften the blow of job loss and fund transitional retraining periods.

They provide a platform for citizen science at a global scale that can be focused on the most challenging technical problems faced in AI applications. They can be globally inclusive through low barriers to entry by providing access to relevant domain specific datasets, accelerated cloud computing resources and open-source foundational code. Incentive prizes also offer an educational and training opportunity at very low cost to the participant and the communities that form around these challenges are often highly active with widespread exchange of ideas and spontaneous teamwork from distributed teams with complementary approaches to a problem. NVIDIA GPUs accelerate numerous cloud computing platforms that offer the ideal host for AI incentive prizes. NVIDIA has also sponsored incentive prizes that have led to cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas in solving AI challenges with cutting edge results. For example, in the recent Second National Data Science Bowl the winning team was able to apply their AI expertise developed in their careers as financial analysts to solve a challenging medical imagery analysis problem. The AI system they developed could analyze a cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) for a key indicator of heart disease with accuracy comparable to an expert cardiologist but thousands of times faster - this has the potential to save years of valuable time for a human cardiologist throughout their career.

When selecting a model that is different than the default ones in OnPrem.LLM, it is important to inspect the model’s home page and identify the correct prompt format.

I noticed a family of ducks waddling through a nearby park this morning.\n2. As I walked by a tree, I saw a flurry of feathers and realized a bird had just landed in its branches.\n3. While driving, I observed a herd of deer gracefully moving through a meadow.\n4. The sun's rays filtered through the leaves of trees, casting intricate patterns on the ground below.\n5. As I stepped outside, a gentle breeze carried with it the fragrance of blooming flowers.\n6. A butterfly fluttered past me as I was sitting in my garden, reminding me to enjoy life's simple pleasures.\n7. The sound of birdsong filled the air as I walked through a park this afternoon.\n8. I saw a group of ants working together to move a large pebble across the sidewalk.\n9. A squirrel darted up a tree, leaving a trail of nuts behind it.\n10. The leaves on the trees rustled as if whispering secrets in the wind.\n11. While hiking, I noticed the way sunlight filtered through the canopy of trees, creating patterns on the forest floor below.\n12. A dragonfly landed on a nearby pond, dipping its long legs into the water to drink.\n13. The chirping of crickets filled the air as I walked past a field this evening.\n14. The sky transformed from shades of blue to orange and red as the sun began to set.\n15. As the day came to a close, I watched as fireflies danced among the trees.\n16. A group of geese honked in unison as they flew overhead this afternoon.\n17. The way a butterfly's wings looked like delicate stained glass as it perched on a flower.\n18. The way the sun's rays seemed to bathe everything around me in a warm, golden light.\n19. As I walked by a field, I saw a group of rabbits darting through the tall grass.\n20.

Even with today’s seemingly fast pace of AI breakthroughs, the development of long-promised technologies such as self-driving cars, housekeeping robots, and conversational companions has turned out to be much harder than many people expected. One reason for these repeating cycles is our limited understanding of the nature and complexity of intelligence itself. In this paper I describe four fallacies in common assumptions made by AI researchers, which can lead to overconﬁdent predictions about the ﬁeld. I conclude by discussing the open questions spurred by these fallacies, including the age-old challenge of imbuing machines with humanlike common sense. Introduction The year 2020 was supposed to herald the arrival of self-driving cars. Five years earlier, a headline in The Guardian predicted that “From 2020 you will become a permanent backseat driver” [1]. In 2016 Business Insider assured us that “10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020” [2]. Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk promised in 2019 that “A year from now, we’ll have over a million cars with full self-driving, software...everything” [3]. And 2020 was the target announced by several automobile companies to bring self-driving cars to market [4, 5, 6]. Despite attempts to redeﬁne “full self-driving” into existence [7], none of these predictions has come true. It’s worth quoting AI expert Drew McDermott on what can happen when over-optimism about AI systems—in particular, self-driving cars—turns out to be wrong: Perhaps expectations are too high, and... this will eventually result in disaster. [S]uppose that ﬁve years from now\n\n\n1\nNA\n[funding] collapses miserably as autonomous vehicles fail to roll. Every startup company fails. And there’s a big backlash so that you can’t get money for anything connected with AI. Everybody hurriedly changes the names of their research projects to something else. This condition [is] called the “AI Winter” [8]. What’s most notable is that McDermott’s warning is from 1984, when, like today, the ﬁeld of AI was awash with conﬁdent optimism about the near future of machine intelligence. McDermott was writing about a cyclical pattern in the ﬁeld. New, apparent breakthroughs would lead AI practitioners to predict rapid progress, successful commercialization, and the near-term prospects of “true AI.” Governments and companies would get caught up in the enthusiasm, and would shower the ﬁeld with research and development funding. AI Spring would be in bloom. When progress stalled, the enthusiasm, funding, and jobs would dry up. AI Winter would arrive. Indeed, about ﬁve years after McDermott’s warning, a new AI winter set in. In this chapter I explore the reasons for the repeating cycle of overconﬁdence followed by disappointment in expectations about AI. I argue that over-optimism among the public, the media, and even experts can 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try another:\n\n!wget --user-agent=\"Mozilla\" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10703.pdf -O /tmp/ktrain.pdf -q\n\n\ndf = extractor.apply(prompt, fpath='/tmp/ktrain.pdf', pdf_pages=[1], stop=['\\n'])\ndf.loc[df['Extractions'] != 'NA'].Extractions[0]\n\n'Institute for Defense Analyses'\n\n\nLet’s try a paper with multiple affiliations.\n\n!wget --user-agent=\"Mozilla\" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06643.pdf -O /tmp/multi-example.pdf -q\n\n\ndf = extractor.apply(prompt, fpath='/tmp/multi-example.pdf', pdf_pages=[1], stop=['\\n'])\ndf.loc[df['Extractions'] != 'NA'].Extractions[0]\n\n'Technical University of Denmark, University of Copenhagen'",
